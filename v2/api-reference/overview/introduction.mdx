description: API endpoints of NewsCatcher News API v2

_There's a lot that can be done using our news API, and we are constantly
working on new endpoints/functions that might make your job easier for you. That
being said, these are the most commonly used methods:_

### Search news `/search`

Want to get the most relevant articles for your needs, use our `/search`
endpoint. It enables you to filter out millions of articles based on keywords,
publish date, language, country of origin, and more.

### Latest headlines `/latest_headlines`

Don't have any specific keywords you want to focus on? Just need to get the
latest news articles? Use NewsCatcer's `/latest_headlines` method. You can still
filter the results on their country, language, topic, sources, etc, but no
keywords.

### Sources `/sources`

Need to check if we scrape the media outlets you need? Use our `/sources`
endpoint to fetch the list of all sources we have. You can filter the results
using language, country, and topic.
