title: Migrate from V1/RapidAPI
description:
  Starting September 2021, we will onboard new users via our own [internal API
  Management platform](https://app.newscatcherapi.com/dashboard/).
---

## What's new?

Migrating on our own Managing Platform is a well-considered step that goes align
with **V2** of Our **News API.**

In V2 we improved:

- **Extraction Algorithms**. We now are able to extract news from almost any
  website.
- Over **60 000** news sources. Compare to 30 000 in V1.
- Around **1 million a day**. Compare to 400k in V1.
- **New Parameters**.
- **New output variables** are given for each article.
  `published_date_precision`, `is_opinion`, `twitter_account`

## New parameters

`published_date_precision` There are 3 types of date precision we define:

- `full` — day and time of an article is correctly identified with the
  appropriate timezone
- `timezone unknown` — day and time of an article is correctly identified
  without timezone
- `date` — only the day is identified without an exact time

`countries` and `not_countries` are now used instead of `country` and now
multiple countries can be searched for.

`lang` and `not_lang` are also available now.

## How to migrate

If you want to migrate, you **do not need a RapidAPI User** account anymore.
Everything will be managed by our own platform.

- [x] Go to our
      [internal API Management platform](https://app.newscatcherapi.com/dashboard/)
      and create a new account

- [x] By default, you will be subscribed to a Free Account 1 000 API calls (10
      000 if you put your business mail)
- [x] Here is how your Account page will look like when logged in:

- Once you have an API key, you can start making API calls on at
  `https://api.newscatcherapi.com/v2/search`. Do not forget to put into headers
  => **x-api-key: \<YOUR_API_KEY>.** Check our
  [Authentication page](/v2/api-reference/overview/authentication) if something
  is not clear to you.
- If you want to upgrade to Paid Plan, from your account page you should see an
  "_Upgrade_" button. If you do not, just contact us at
  `mailto:artem@newscatcherapi.com`
