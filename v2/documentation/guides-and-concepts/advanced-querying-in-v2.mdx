## Query parameter `q`

In case you're not the type of developer who will read through the entire
section, here're 3 most important rules that you have to follow:

1. Be aware that, by default, tokens (keywords you're searching for) passed into
   the q parameter are split with `AND` operator. This means each token has to
   be present in the text at least once. For example, `q=Apple Microsoft` will
   be read as `q=Apple AND Microsoft`

2. Always use double quotes `"` when you search for companies, person names,
   etc. For example, if you want to find articles where `Tim Cook` is mentioned,
   you should pass `q="Tim Cook"` not `q=Tim Cook`

3. Make sure that what you pass into the q parameter is
   [URL-encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding).

4. While making your first calls, check the `user_input` list in the JSON that
   we return to you. Make sure our API saw your keywords as you intended.

## Exact Match with "double quotes"

Use double quotes `"` for the exact match.

When you want to search for articles that mention Tim Cook you should do the
following query:

```bash
q="Tim Cook"
```

If you write `q=Tim Cook` then it will be treated as `q=Tim AND Cook`. In that
case, every article that mentions `tim` and `cook` will match.

Moreover, if you specify `lang=en` that will also match the articles with
`cooking`, `cooked`, and other stems of the word `cook`.

## Boolean: `AND`

`AND` operator makes tokens from both sides to be present in the text.

`AND` is the default operator. When your q input is more than 1 word, `AND`
operator is added between each word behind the scenes. Therefore,
`q=Apple Microsoft Tesla` is the same as `q=Apple AND Microsoft AND Tesla`

For example, if we want both `Microsoft` and `Tesla` to be present in the
returned news articles, the `q` parameter should look as follows:

```bash
q=Microsoft AND Tesla
```

or

```bash
q=Microsoft && Tesla
```

## Boolean: `OR`

`OR` can also be written as ||

`OR` operator means that either the left or the right sides of `OR` have to be
satisfied.

You should use Grouping when you want to logically group a set of tokens. For
example:

```bash
q=(Apple AND Cook) OR (Microsoft AND Gates)
```

or

```bash
q=(Apple && Cook) || (Microsoft && Gates)
```

## Boolean: `NOT`

`NOT` can also be written as !

Use `NOT` operator when you want the token from its right not to be present. For
example, if we want to search for articles about Microsoft and not about Tesla,
the `q` parameter should look as follows:

```bash
q=Microsoft NOT Tesla
```

or

```bash
q=Microsoft !Tesla
```

## MUST (MUST NOT)

Follow these `MUST` rules:

- Prepend a token with a `+` (plus sign) if it MUST appear in the searched text.
- Make sure that your API call is URL encoded. Check the `user_input` object in
  the Response Body to see how our back end saw your request.
- Remember that a `+` (plus sign) will be escaped by default in many situations.
  Therefore, we recommend using its URL-encoded version: `%2B`

Follow these `NOT MUST` rules:

- Prepend a token with a `-` (minus sign) if it MUST NOT appear in the searched
  text. For example, if we want to search for news articles that contain Elon
  Musk but not Grimes, we have to write:

```bash
q=Elon Musk -Grimes
```

But wait, the query above will also match the documents where only `Elon` or
`Musk` are present. Shouldn't we write `+Elon +Musk -Grimes`?

If we write `+Elon +Musk -Grimes` that means that `Elon` and `Musk` should be
present in the text, however, not in that particular. The "correct" query should
look like this:

```bash
q="Elon Musk" -Grimes
```

In this case, we will search for an exact match of `"Elon Musk"` , plus,
`Grimes` must not be present.

<Note>
  In general, you should always put person and company names in quotes.
</Note>

## Wildcards `*` and `?`

- Use `*` to match any string in any quantity.
- Use `?` to match any string exactly once.

For example, we want to search for articles that mention `Microsort` and any
C-level officers:

```bash
q=Microsoft +C?O
```
