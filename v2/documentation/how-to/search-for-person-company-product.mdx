---

Looking for news mentioning a specific **Person**, **Company** or **Product** is
a common application for our users.

Use the following recommendations to maximize your chances of getting the most
relevant results using our News API.

## Advice #1: Always use double quotes (**`"`**) in **`q`** parameter

Use double quotes (**`"`**) for the **exact match**.

**Example of the search intent**

_I am looking for articles about Elon Musk._

**Query to do it**

When you want to search for articles that mention `Elon Musk` you should do the
following query:

If you write `q=Elon Musk` then, it will be treated as `q=Elon AND Musk`. In
that case, every article that mentions both `elon` and `musk` somewhere in the
text will match.

## Advice #2: Use all available operators In `q` parameter to search with more context-related articles

Here are the Operators that can help you narrow down your search.

### `AND`

**`AND`** operator makes tokens from both sides to be present in the text of an
article.

**`AND`** is the default operator. When your `**q**` input is more than 1 word,
`**AND**` operator is added between each word behind the scenes.

**Example of the search intent**

_I am looking for articles where_ _**all three**_ _Apple, Microsoft, and Tesla
company names are mentioned_

**Query to do it**

```
q=Apple AND Microsoft AND Tesla
```

Since `AND` is the default operator, these two queries are exactly the same:

**`q=Apple AND Microsoft AND Tesla`**

**`q=Apple Microsoft Tesla`**

### `OR`

**`OR`** operator means that either the left or the right sides of `OR` have to
be satisfied.

**Example of the search intent**

_I am looking for an article where_ _**at least one**_ _of these wealthy men
Elon Musk, Tim Cook, Bill Gates is mentioned._

**Query to do it**

```
q="Elon Musk" OR "Tim Cook" OR "Bill Gates"
```

### Round brackets `()`

`AND` and `OR` operators can be used together. You can also logically group a
set of words or phrases by using round brackets `()`

**Example of the search intent**

_I am looking for articles where either Elon Musk is mentioned with_
_**either**_ _Starlink_ _**or**_ _Tesla._

**Query to do it**

```
q="Elon Musk" AND (Starlink OR Tesla)
```

### `NOT`

Use `NOT` operator when you want the token from its right to **not be present**.

**Example of the search intent**

_I am looking for articles about Apple and MacBook product series, but I do not
want any news related to iPhone or IPad_

**Query to do it**

```
q=Apple AND MacBook NOT (IPhone OR IPad)
```

### More examples

The more operator and logical combinations you use, the more relevant results
you get.

Let's look at some more examples

**Example of the search intent**

_I am looking for articles about Apple company. "Apple" as a word, can have
multiple definitions. So, when I search for the word "Apple", I want to have
some other words related to Apple in this case, like their products: MacBook,
iPhone, IPad, or executive Chiefs, like Tim Cook, Katherine Adams, Eddy Cue. I
add to the search "Apple Inc" as well because I am pretty sure it is about Apple
company. I do not want to have any other big tech company mentioned in the
article, so I filter out Microsoft, Amazon, Tencent, and Facebook._

**Query to do it**

```
q=(Apple AND (MacBook OR iPhone OR IPad OR "Tim Cook" OR "Katherine Adams" OR "Eddy Cue")) OR "Apple Inc" NOT (Microsoft OR Amazon OR Tencent OR Facebook)
```

We have around **60 000 news sources**, but not all of them are relevant to you.

### `[sources]`

Use `[sources]` parameter to filter down your search to the articles coming only
from mentioned news sources.

**Example of the search intent**

_I am looking for business-related articles about "Elon Musk". Personally, I
have already seen relevant news coming from businessinsuder.com,
businessjournaldaily.com, businessreport.com. I want to have articles only from
these sources._

**Parameters to use**

```
q="Elon Musk"
sources=businessinsider.com,businessjournaldaily.com,businessreport.com
```

### `[not_sources]`

Use `[not_sources]` parameter to exclude concrete news domains from your search.

**Example of the search intent**

_I am looking for business-related articles about "Elon Musk". I am not aware of
any business-related news source. But, I am sure that news coming from
gossipbucket.com, hollywoodlife.com, or hollywoodreporter.com is not the type of
news I would like to get. So I exclude these news domains._

**Parameters to use**

```
q="Elon Musk"
sources=gossipbucket.com,hollywoodlife.com,hollywoodreporter.com
```

## Advice #4: Use `to_rank` Or `from_rank` To Vary From Global News Sources To More Local Once

Our `rank` parameter is based on the
[Majestic Million Rank system](https://blog.ultimate-uk.com/what-is-the-majestic-million).
The smaller the rank, the more popular the news domain. The "popularity" is
measured by the number of backlinks and referrers on the web. Some examples of
ranks:

- nytimes.com => 40
- reuters.com => 86
- china.com.cn => 962
- stthomassource.com => 120496

**Example of the search intent**

_I am looking for articles about Microsoft Patents. I trust only global media_.

**Parameters to use**

```bash
q=Microsoft AND patent
to_rank=10000
```

**Example of the search intent**

_I am looking for articles about Microsoft Patents. I am not interested in the
most popular news sources like Forbes or Washington Post_. _I am curious to know
what other small media posted._

**Parameters to use**

```bash
q=Microsoft AND patent
ranked_only=False
from_rank=100000
```

By default, `ranked_only` parameter is set to `True`. It means that if a news
domain is not in the Majestic List, we will attribute the value 999,999 to this
domain. If you want to get articles from these unranked domains, you should set
`ranked_only=False`
