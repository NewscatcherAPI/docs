## How to use pygooglenews with [ScrapingBee](https://www.scrapingbee.com/?fpr=artem26)

Every function has `scrapingbee` parameter. It accepts your [ScrapingBee](https://www.scrapingbee.com/?fpr=artem26) API key that will be used to get the response from Google's servers.

You can take a look at what exactly is happening in the source code: check for `__scaping_bee_request()` function under GoogleNews class

Pay attention to the concurrency of each plan at [ScrapingBee](https://www.scrapingbee.com/?fpr=artem26)

How to use example:

```python
gn = GoogleNews()

# it's a fake API key, do not try to use it
gn.top_news(scraping_bee = 'I5SYNPRFZI41WHVQWWUT0GNXFMO104343E7CXFIISR01E2V8ETSMXMJFK1XNKM7FDEEPUPRM0FYAHFF5')
```

### How to use pygooglenews with proxies

So, if you have your own HTTP/HTTPS proxy(s) that you want to use to make requests to Google, that's how you do it:

```python
gn = GoogleNews()

gn.top_news(proxies = {'https':'34.91.135.38:80'})
```
