---

### GoogleNews Class

```python
from pygooglenews import GoogleNews
# default GoogleNews instance
gn = GoogleNews(lang = 'en', country = 'US')
```

To get access to all the functions, you first have to initiate the `GoogleNews`
class.

It has 2 required variables: `lang` and `country`

You can try any combination of those 2, however, it does not exist for all. Only
the combinations that are supported by GoogleNews will work. Check the official
Google News page to check what is covered:

On the bottom left side of the Google News page, you may find a
`Language & region` section where you can find all of the supported
combinations.

For example, for `country=UA` (Ukraine), there are 2 languages supported:

- `lang=uk` Ukrainian
- `lang=ru` Russian

### Top Stories

```bash
top = gn.top_news(proxies=None, scraping_bee = None)
```

`top_news()` returns the top stories for the selected country and language that
are defined in `GoogleNews` class. The returned object contains `feed`
(FeedParserDict) and `entries` list of articles found with all data parsed.

---

### Stories by Topic

```bash
business = gn.topic_headlines('BUSINESS', proxies=None, scraping_bee = None)
```

The returned object contains `feed` (FeedParserDict) and `entries` list of
articles found with all data parsed.

Accepted topics are:

- `WORLD`
- `NATION`
- `BUSINESS`
- `TECHNOLOGY`
- `ENTERTAINMENT`
- `SCIENCE`
- `SPORTS`
- `HEALTH`

However, you can find some other topics that are also supported by Google News.

For example, if you search for `corona` in the search tab of `en` + `US` you
will find `COVID-19` as a topic.

The URL looks like this:
`https://news.google.com/topics/CAAqIggKIhxDQkFTRHdvSkwyMHZNREZqY0hsNUVnSmxiaWdBUAE?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen`

We have to copy the text after `topics/` and before `?`, then you can use it as
an input for the `top_news()` function.

```python
from pygooglenews import GoogleNews

gn = GoogleNews()
covid = gn.topic_headlines('CAAqIggKIhxDQkFTRHdvSkwyMHZNREZqY0hsNUVnSmxiaWdBUAE')
```

<Warning>
    However, be aware that this topic will be unique for each language/country combination.

</Warning>

### Stories by Geolocation

```python
gn = GoogleNews('uk', 'UA')
kyiv = gn.geo_headlines('kyiv', proxies=None, scraping_bee = None)
# or
kyiv = gn.geo_headlines('kiev', proxies=None, scraping_bee = None)
# or
kyiv = gn.geo_headlines('киев', proxies=None, scraping_bee = None)
# or
kyiv = gn.geo_headlines('Київ', proxies=None, scraping_bee = None)
```

The returned object contains `feed` (FeedParserDict) and `entries` list of
articles found with all data parsed.

All of the above variations will return the same feed of the latest news about
Kyiv, Ukraine:

```
geo['feed'].title

# 'Київ - Останні - Google Новини'
```

It is language-agnostic, however, it does not guarantee that the feed for any
specific place will exist. For example, if you want to find the feed on `LA` or
`Los Angeles` you can do it with `GoogleNews('en', 'US')`.

The main (`en`, `US`) Google News client will most likely find the feed about
the most places.

#### Stories by a Query

```
gn.search(query: str, helper = True, when = None, from_ = None, to_ = None, proxies=None, scraping_bee=None)
```

The returned object contains `feed` (FeedParserDict) and `entries` list of
articles found with all data parsed.

Google News search itself is a complex function that has inherited some features
from the standard Google Search.

[The official reference on what could be inserted](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/docs/xml_results)

The biggest obstacle that you might have is to write the URL-escaping input. To
ease this process, `helper = True` is turned on by default.

`helper` uses `urllib.parse.quote_plus` to automatically convert the input.

For example:

- `'New York metro opening'` --> `'New+York+metro+opening'`
- `'AAPL -MSFT'` --> `'AAPL+-MSFT'`
- `'"Tokyo Olimpics date changes"'` --> `'%22Tokyo+Olimpics+date+changes%22'`

You can turn it off and write your own query in case you need it by
`helper = False`

`when` parameter (`str`) sets the time range for the published datetime. I could
not find any documentation regarding this option, but here is what I deducted:

- `h` for hours.(For me, worked for up to `101h`). `when=12h` will search for
  only the articles matching the `search` criteria and published for the last 12
  hours
- `d` for days
- `m` for a amonth (For me, worked for up to `48m`)

I did not set any hard limit here. You may try put here anything. Probably, it
will work. However, I would like to warn you that wrong inputs will not lead to
an error. Instead, the `when` parameter will be ignored by the Google.

`from_` and `to_` accept the following format of date: `%Y-%m-%d` For example,
`2020-07-01`

### Output Body

All 4 functions return the `dictionary` that has 2 sub-objects:

- `feed` - contains the information on the feed metadata
- `entries` - contains the parsed articles

Both are inherited from the
[Feedparser](https://github.com/kurtmckee/feedparser). The only change is that
each dictionary under `entries` also contains `sub_articles` which are the
similar articles found in the description. Usually, it is non-empty for
`top_news()` and `topic_headlines()` feeds.

<Tip>
  Tip To check what is the found feed's name just check the `title` under the
  `feed` dictionary
