## Available modules

CatchAll modules are organized into Actions and Searches. Actions perform 
operations, while Searches retrieve data.

### Actions

| Module            | Description               | Endpoint                             |
| ----------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `submit-query`    | Create a new CatchAll job | `/catchAll/submit`                   |
| `create-monitor`  | Schedule recurring jobs   | `/catchAll/monitors/create`          |
| `create-monitor-with-webhook` | Schedule recurring jobs with webhook | `/catchAll/monitors/create` |
| `enable-monitor`  | Resume a paused monitor   | `/catchAll/monitors/{id}/enable`     |
| `disable-monitor` | Pause a running monitor   | `/catchAll/monitors/{id}/disable`    |

<Note>
  The `create-monitor-with-webhook` module supports webhook URL and HTTP method. 
  For advanced webhook configuration (custom headers, query parameters, or basic 
  auth), use the API directly.
</Note>

### Searches

| Module                 | Description                    | Endpoint                         |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| `search-job-id`        | Check job processing status    | `/catchAll/status/{job_id}`      |
| `pull-data`            | Retrieve completed job results | `/catchAll/pull/{job_id}`        |
| `get-monitor-schedule` | List monitor execution history | `/catchAll/monitors/{id}/jobs`   |
| `pull-monitor-results` | Get aggregated monitor records | `/catchAll/monitors/pull/{id}`   |

## Jobs workflow

Build a scenario that submits a CatchAll job, waits for completion, and sends
results via email.

</Note>

### Add modules

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add Sleep module">
    Add **Tools > Sleep**:

    - **Delay**: `1`

    The Sleep module starts the scenario execution. The 1-second delay ensures 
    all modules initialize properly before submitting the job.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Submit job">
    Add **NewsCatcher CatchAll > submit-query**:

    - **Connection**: Select your CatchAll connection
    - **Query**: Enter a natural language question
    - **Context** (optional): Add focus instructions
    - **Schema** (optional): Specify output format template
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add polling loop">
    Add **Flow Control > Repeater**:

    - **Initial value**: `1`
    - **Repeats**: `10`

    The Repeater creates a loop that checks job status up to 10 times (5 minutes 
    maximum with 30-second intervals).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Wait before check">
    Add **Tools > Sleep**:

    - **Delay**: `30`

    Wait 30 seconds between status checks.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check status">
    Add **NewsCatcher CatchAll > search-job-id**:

    - **Connection**: Select your CatchAll connection
    - **Job ID**: Drag `job_id` from the **submit-query** module
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Iterator">
    Add **Flow Control > Iterator**:

    - **Array**: Drag `steps` from the **search-job-id** module

    The Iterator splits the steps array into individual step objects, making 
    Router conditions simpler.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Router">
    Add **Flow Control > Router** to handle different job states.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  **Customize timing**: The Repeater iterations and Sleep duration can be 
  adjusted based on your needs. Increase iterations for longer-running jobs or 
  decrease them to stay within scenario execution limits.
</Tip>

### Configure routes

The Router evaluates job status and directs execution to one of two routes.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Route 1: Job complete">
    Configure the first route:

    1. Click the route path to open filter settings
    2. **Label**: `Complete`
    3. **Set as fallback**: `No`
    4. **Condition** (Add two conditions with AND):
       - First condition: Drag `status` from **Iterator** output
         - **Operator**: `Text operators: Equal to`
         - **Value**: `completed`
       - Click **Add AND rule**
       - Second condition: Drag `completed` from **Iterator** output
         - **Operator**: `Boolean operators: Equal to`
         - **Value**: `true`
    5. Click **Save**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Route 2: Job failed">
    Configure the second route:

    1. Click the route path to open filter settings
    2. **Label**: `Failed`
    3. **Set as fallback**: `No`
    4. **Condition** (Add two conditions with AND):
       - First condition: Drag `status` from **Iterator** output
         - **Operator**: `Text operators: Equal to`
         - **Value**: `failed`
       - Click **Add AND rule**
       - Second condition: Drag `completed` from **Iterator** output
         - **Operator**: `Boolean operators: Equal to`
         - **Value**: `true`
    5. Click **Save**
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  If neither route condition is met, the Repeater continues to the next 
  iteration automatically.
</Note>

### Add route actions

<Steps>
  <Step title="Complete route actions">
    On the **Complete** route path:

    1. Add **Tools > Increment function**:
       - **Reset a value**: `After one cycle`
    2. Add a **filter** to the connection line after Increment:
       - Drag the increment value (labeled `i`) from **Increment function** output
       - **Operator**: `Text operators: Equal to`
       - **Value**: `1`
       
       The filter ensures the email sends only once when the route first triggers.
    3. Add **NewsCatcher CatchAll > pull-data**:
       - **Connection**: Select your connection
       - **Job ID**: Drag `job_id` from **submit-query** module
    4. Add **Gmail > Send an Email** and configure it to send results to your email address
  </Step>

  <Step title="Failed route actions">
    On the **Failed** route path:

    1. Add **Tools > Increment function**:
       - **Reset a value**: `After one cycle`
    2. Add a **filter** to the connection line after Increment:
       - Drag the increment value (labeled `i`) from **Increment function** output
       - **Operator**: `Text operators: Equal to`
       - **Value**: `1`
    3. Add **Gmail > Send an Email** to notify yourself of the failure
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Test Jobs workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Run scenario">
    Click **Run once** at the bottom of the editor.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Monitor execution">
    Watch the scenario execute. The Repeater checks job status every 30 seconds 
    (up to 10 times, 5 minutes maximum) until the job completes or fails.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check email">
    When complete, you receive an email with the job results.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  If jobs consistently take longer than 5 minutes to complete, increase the 
  Repeater **Repeats** value to 15 or 20.
</Tip>

## Monitors workflow

Build a scenario that creates a monitor from a completed job, verifies creation, 
and retrieves the initial results.

![Make.com scenario flow diagram showing modules connected in sequence: NewsCatcher CatchAll create-monitor module connects to a Repeater loop containing a Router. The Router splits into two paths - one for successful monitor creation (leading to Sleep, pull-monitor-results, and Gmail success notification) and one for creation failure (leading to Sleep and Gmail error notification).](/images/integrations/make-monitors-demo-workflow.png)

<Note>
  Want to skip manual setup? Import the [Monitors demo scenario](https://us2.make.com/public/shared-scenario/sUKDajtqdwB/demo-monitors) directly into your Make.com account.
</Note>

### Add modules

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create monitor">
    Add **NewsCatcher CatchAll > create-monitor**:

    - **Connection**: Select your CatchAll connection
    - **Reference Job ID**: Enter the job ID from a completed job
    - **Schedule**: Enter schedule in natural language
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Repeater">
    Add **Flow Control > Repeater**:

    - **Initial value**: `1`
    - **Repeats**: `3`

    The Repeater retries status evaluation up to 3 times if monitor creation is 
    delayed.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Router">
    Add **Flow Control > Router** to handle creation success or failure.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Configure routes

The Router evaluates monitor creation status and directs execution to one of two routes.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Route 1: Monitor created">
    Configure the first route:

    1. Click the route path to open filter settings
    2. **Label**: `Success`
    3. **Set as fallback**: `No`
    4. **Condition**:
       - Drag `status` from **create-monitor** output
       - **Operator**: `Text operators: Equal to`
       - **Value**: `Monitor Created Successfully`
    5. Click **Save**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Route 2: Creation failed">
    Configure the second route:

    1. Click the route path to open filter settings
    2. **Label**: `Failed`
    3. **Set as fallback**: `No`
    4. **Condition**:
       - Drag `status` from **create-monitor** output
       - **Operator**: `Text operators: Not equal to`
       - **Value**: `Monitor Created Successfully`
    5. Click **Save**
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Add route actions

<Steps>
  <Step title="Success route actions">
    On the **Success** route path:

    1. Add **Tools > Sleep**:
       - **Delay**: `1`
    2. Add **NewsCatcher CatchAll > pull-monitor-results**:
       - **Connection**: Select your connection
       - **Monitor ID**: Drag `monitor_id` from **create-monitor** module
    3. Add **Gmail > Send an Email** to send initial monitor results
  </Step>

  <Step title="Failed route actions">
    On the **Failed** route path:

    1. Add **Tools > Sleep**:
       - **Delay**: `1`
    2. Add **Gmail > Send an Email** to notify yourself of the creation failure
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Test Monitors workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prepare reference job">
    You need a completed job ID to create a monitor. If you don't have one, run a 
    Jobs workflow first to generate a job ID.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run scenario">
    Click **Run once** at the bottom of the editor.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Monitor execution">
    The Router evaluates the creation status immediately.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check email">
    You receive an email confirming monitor creation success or failure.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  After creating a monitor, it runs automatically on your schedule. Use 
  `pull-monitor-results` periodically to retrieve aggregated data from all 
  executions.
</Tip>

## Next steps

After verifying that your integrations work, replace the Gmail module with your
destination system:

- **Google Sheets** to save records to spreadsheet.
- **Airtable** to store structured data.
- **Webhook** to send to another service.
- **Slack/Discord** to post notifications.
