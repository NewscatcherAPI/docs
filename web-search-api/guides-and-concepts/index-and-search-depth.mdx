  How CatchAll's web index works and what start_date and end_date actually
  control.

## How web index works

CatchAll searches a continuously updated web index, where each web page is
recorded by the date it was discovered — not by the date of the event it
describes.

This means a web page discovered today can describe an event from six months
ago. When you run a search, CatchAll looks at all web pages discovered within
your date window, regardless of the events they cover. This also means that even
a narrow search window can surface events outside that window, because recent
web pages often reference older events.

## Search depth

Search depth is how far back in the index your search goes — for example, the
last month or the last year.

A simple way to think about it:

- **Search depth** is the haystack — the set of web pages CatchAll looks
  through.
- **Your query and validators** are the needle — what you are looking for inside
  those pages.

## What start_date and end_date control

The `start_date` and `end_date` parameters define your search window. They
control **which web pages** are searched, not **which events** are returned.

| Parameter    | What it controls                                        |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `start_date` | Earliest web page discovery date included in the search |
| `end_date`   | Latest web page discovery date included in the search   |

If you use the CatchAll UI, the Search Depth control ("Last N
days/weeks/months") maps directly to these parameters.

To get more results for a specific event period, use a wider search window. This
picks up both web pages published close to the time events happened and those
published later that reference the same events.

## Example

You are looking for AI startup funding rounds from early 2025. You set up your
query and validators to match that event.

The same event can be covered by multiple web pages discovered at different
times. With a search window of **last 30 days**:

| Web page                                                   | Discovery date | Included in search? |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------- |
| Reports a January 2025 funding round, discovered last week | Last week      | ✅ Yes              |
| Reports the same round, discovered in January 2025         | January 2025   | ❌ No               |

Extending the window back to January 2025 includes both web pages, giving you
more complete results.

## Plan limits

Your plan sets the maximum search depth available to you, which determines the
earliest `start_date` you can request. If you request a date range beyond your
plan's limit:

- `POST /catchAll/initialize` adjusts the dates automatically and returns a
  `date_modification_message` explaining what changed.
- `POST /catchAll/submit` returns a `400` error with a specific message.

Use the initialize endpoint to check your effective date range before submitting
a job.
