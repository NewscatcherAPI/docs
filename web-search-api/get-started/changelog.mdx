<Update label="1.0.0" description="2026-02-05">
## Stable release with enhanced control and structured company enrichments

CatchAll API reaches v1.0.0 with improved query customization, date range
controls, and structured company enrichments.

**Features:**

- **Initialize endpoint**: Get suggested validators, enrichments, and date
  ranges before submitting jobs. Returns `date_modification_message` when
  requested dates exceed plan limits.
- **Date range controls**: Specify `start_date` and `end_date` in submit
  requests. System validates against plan limits and returns 400 errors for
  invalid ranges.
- **Custom validators and enrichments**: Define custom validation criteria and
  extraction fields directly in submit requests instead of relying on automatic
  generation.
- **Company enrichment type**: Extract structured company data including name,
  alternative names, website candidates, people, and address using the new
  `company` enrichment type.
- **Paginated user jobs**: List user jobs endpoint now supports `page` and
  `page_size` parameters for efficient retrieval of job history.

**Endpoints:**

- [`POST /catchAll/initialize`](/web-search-api/api-reference/jobs/initialize-job) — Get
  validator, enrichment, and date range suggestions.
- Enhanced [`POST /catchAll/submit`](/web-search-api/api-reference/jobs/create-job) — Now
  accepts date ranges, validators, and enrichments.
- Enhanced [`GET /catchAll/jobs/user`](/web-search-api/api-reference/jobs/list-user-jobs) —
  Now supports pagination.

**Improvements:**

- Enhanced deduplication logic reduces duplicate records across job executions.
- Status endpoint returns more accurate current processing stage.
- User jobs endpoint returns results sorted by creation date (most recent
  first).

</Update>

<Update label="0.6.1" description="2026-01-13">
## Job continuation and early result access

**Features:**

- **Job continuation**: Submit jobs with the optional `limit` parameter for fast
  testing. Review results and continue jobs with `/catchAll/continue` to process
  more records without restarting.
- **Early result access**: Pull results during the `enriching` stage without
  waiting for job completion. A new `progress_validated` field shows validation
  progress as results become available in batches.
- **Monitor updates**: Update webhook configuration for existing monitors
  without recreating them.

**Endpoints:**

- [`POST /catchAll/continue`](/web-search-api/api-reference/jobs/continue-job) — Continue
  completed job with higher limit.
- [`PATCH /catchAll/monitors/{monitor_id}`](/web-search-api/api-reference/monitors/update-monitor)
  — Update monitor webhook configuration.

**Improvements:**

- Expanded search range provides broader coverage for improved recall.

</Update>

<Update label="0.5.1" description="2025-12-11">
## API response enhancements and monitor configuration

**Features:**

- **Enrichments metadata**: Job pull endpoint returns `enrichments` array
  listing all extracted field names.
- **Human-readable schedules**: Monitor list includes `schedule_human_readable`
  alongside cron expressions.
- **Webhook visibility**: Monitor list exposes full webhook configuration
  including URL, method, and headers.

**Improvements:**

- Pull endpoints return all citations without limits.
- Monitors require minimum 24-hour intervals between executions.
- First webhook execution includes complete reference job results.
- Improved validation error messages for invalid schedules.

</Update>

<Update label="0.4.10" description="2025-11-18">
## Status tracking and monitor improvements

Enhanced status tracking with processing steps and improved monitor
functionality for time-constrained queries.

**Features:**

- **Progress tracking**: Status endpoint now returns detailed
  [`steps`](/web-search-api/api-reference/jobs/get-job-status#response-steps) array showing
  completion state for each processing stage.
- **Monitor timestamps**: Monitor records include `added_on` and `updated_on`
  fields to track when each data record was first collected and last updated
  across job executions.
- **Time-constrained jobs**: Monitors now work with reference jobs that include
  time constraints. The system automatically adapts date-specific validators for
  each execution.

**Improvements:**

- [`GET /catchAll/jobs/user`](/web-search-api/api-reference/jobs/list-user-jobs) now
  returns only user-created jobs, excluding repeated monitor jobs.
- Monitor responses use
  [`run_info`](/web-search-api/api-reference/monitors/get-monitor-results#response-run-info)
  structure with `first_run` and `last_run` timestamps instead of `date_range`
  for clearer execution metadata.
- Improved error handling in monitor creation endpoint with specific validation
  messages for invalid schedules and incomplete reference jobs.

</Update>

<Update label="0.4.5" description="2025-11-08">
## Monitor webhooks and deduplication

Introduced webhook notifications and intelligent deduplication for monitors to
streamline automated data collection workflows.

**Features:**

- **Webhook notifications**: Receive real-time POST notifications when scheduled
  monitor jobs complete, including monitor ID, latest job ID, and record counts.
- **Intelligent deduplication**: Monitors automatically eliminate duplicate
  records across job executions, sending only new results to webhooks.
- **Monitor management**: Enable or disable monitors to control automated job
  execution.

**Endpoints:**

- [`GET /catchAll/monitors`](/web-search-api/api-reference/monitors/list-monitors) — List all
  monitors for your API key.
- [`POST /catchAll/monitors/{monitor_id}/enable`](/web-search-api/api-reference/monitors/enable-monitor)
  — Enable a disabled monitor.
- [`POST /catchAll/monitors/{monitor_id}/disable`](/web-search-api/api-reference/monitors/disable-monitor)
  — Disable an active monitor.

**Improvements:**

- Reduced default date range from 14 days to 5 days for faster job processing.
- Limited maximum date range to 30 days to maintain optimal performance.
- Fixed special characters displaying incorrectly in article text.
- Improved error handling when monitor jobs have incomplete data.

</Update>

<Update label="0.3.8" description="2025-11-02">
