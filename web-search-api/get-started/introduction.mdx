sidebarTitle: Introduction
description: Find all results, not just top candidates
---

CatchAll is a web search API that generates unique datasets that don't exist 
anywhere else on the web. Built on NewsCatcher's proprietary real-world event 
index, it delivers state-of-the-art recall—finding all relevant events, not just 
top results.

## How it works

CatchAll processes queries through a multi-stage pipeline that analyzes over 
50,000 web pages per job:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Analyze">
    Generates targeted search queries for NewsCatcher's proprietary web index
    and creates validation rules and extraction patterns based on your input.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fetch">
    Retrieves and processes 50,000+ web pages to ensure comprehensive coverage.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Cluster">
    Groups related web pages into distinct real-world events using the Leiden 
    algorithm for community detection.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Validate">
    Applies generated validators to filter clusters, ensuring only relevant 
    events that match your criteria proceed to extraction.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Extract">
    Transforms validated events into structured JSON records with dynamic 
    schemas tailored to your query.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Processing typically takes 10-15 minutes per job. Poll the status endpoint
  every 30-60 seconds to track progress through each stage.
</Note>

<Tip>
  Each job returns structured JSON records with dynamic schemas. Fields like 
  `company_name`, `deal_value`, and `acquisition_date` are automatically 
  generated based on your query.
  
  See the [Quickstart > Review response](/web-search-api/get-started/quickstart#steps) 
  for a complete response example.

## Key characteristics

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Event-centric index" icon="database">
    CatchAll searches NewsCatcher’s continuously updated web index of 2+ billion 
    web pages, optimized for finding real-world events (acquisitions, approvals, 
    incidents). The index is time-series by nature — each web page is recorded by 
    its discovery date, not the date of the event it describes. This means a web 
    page discovered today may report on an event from months ago, yet CatchAll 
    still evaluates it against your query.

    <Tip>
      To learn how the index works and what search depth controls, see
      [Index and search depth](/web-search-api/guides-and-concepts/index-and-search-depth).
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Customizable extraction" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
    Control what data gets extracted by providing custom validators and enrichments, 
    or let the system generate them automatically based on your query.

    **Custom validators** filter which events are relevant:
    ```json
    {
      "name": "is_acquisition",
      "description": "true if web page describes an acquisition",
      "type": "boolean"
    }
    ```

    **Custom enrichments** define what data to extract:
    ```json
    {
      "name": "acquiring_company",
      "description": "Extract the acquiring company name",
      "type": "company"
    }
    ```

    The `company` enrichment type extracts structured data including name, 
    alternative names, website candidates, people, and address.
    
    <Tip>
      Use the [`POST /catchAll/initialize`](/web-search-api/api-reference/jobs/initialize-job) endpoint to get suggested validators and 
      enrichments before submitting your job.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Dynamic schemas" icon="flask">
    Each job generates a unique response schema. Field names and structure in 
    the `enrichment` object vary between jobs—even with identical inputs.

    **Guaranteed fields in every record:**
    - `record_id`
    - `record_title`
    - `enrichment` object
    - `citations` array

    **Variable fields:**
    - All fields inside `enrichment` (names, types, structure)

    <Tip>
      See [Understanding dynamic schemas](/web-search-api/guides-and-concepts/dynamic-schemas) 
      for integration patterns.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Date range controls" icon="calendar">
    The `start_date` and `end_date` parameters define your search window within
    the web index. They control which web pages are searched, not which events
    are returned. A web page within your date range may describe events from
    outside that range.

    Date ranges are validated against your plan's allowed search depth. 
    To preview date adjustments before submitting, you can use 
    [`POST /catchAll/initialize`](/web-search-api/api-reference/jobs/initialize-job).
      
    <Tip>
      To learn how search depth and date ranges work, see
      [Index and search depth](/web-search-api/guides-and-concepts/index-and-search-depth).
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Non-deterministic processing" icon="shuffle">
    Identical queries can produce different results:
    - LLMs may generate different keywords, validators, and extractors
    - Different content sources may be retrieved
    - Field names and structure vary between runs
    - Record counts differ
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Asynchronous operation" icon="clock">
    Each query creates a job that processes asynchronously. Use the returned 
    `job_id` to poll the job status and retrieve results when completed. 
    Processing typically takes 10-15 minutes.
    
    Track detailed progress through the [`steps`](/web-search-api/api-reference/jobs/get-job-status#response-steps) 
    array in the status endpoint response.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Batch processing" icon="layer-group">
    Results become available progressively during the `enriching` stage as 
    validation completes in batches. Check for `status: "enriching"` to retrieve 
    partial results before job completion.
    
    The `progress_validated` field tracks how many candidate clusters have been 
    processed. This allows you to access early results while the job continues 
    processing remaining batches.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Job continuation" icon="rotate">
    Start with fewer records using the `limit` parameter for quick testing, then use
    [`POST /catchAll/continue`](/web-search-api/api-reference/jobs/continue-job) to process more 
    records without re-submitting the query.
    
    Continue requests preserve all analysis, validation, and extraction logic 
    from the original job.
