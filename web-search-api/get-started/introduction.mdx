sidebarTitle: Introduction
description: Find all results, not just top candidates
---

CatchAll is a web search API that generates unique datasets that don't exist 
anywhere else on the web. Built on NewsCatcher's proprietary real-world event 
index, it delivers state-of-the-art recall—finding all relevant events, not just 
top results.

## How it works

CatchAll processes queries through a multi-stage pipeline that analyzes over 
50,000 web pages per job:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Analyze">
    Generates targeted search queries for NewsCatcher's proprietary news index 
    and creates validation rules and extraction patterns based on your input.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fetch">
    Retrieves and processes 50,000+ articles from web sources to ensure 
    comprehensive coverage.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Cluster">
    Groups related articles into distinct real-world events using the Leiden 
    algorithm for community detection.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Validate">
    Applies generated validators to filter clusters, ensuring only relevant 
    events that match your criteria proceed to extraction.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Extract">
    Transforms validated events into structured JSON records with dynamic 
    schemas tailored to your query.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Processing typically takes 10-15 minutes per job. Poll the status endpoint
  every 30-60 seconds to track progress through each stage.
</Note>

<Tip>
  Each job returns structured JSON records with dynamic schemas. Fields like 
  `company_name`, `deal_value`, and `acquisition_date` are automatically 
  generated based on your query.
  
  See the [Quickstart > Review response](/web-search-api/get-started/quickstart#steps) 
  for a complete response example.
</Tip>

## Key characteristics

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Event-centric index" icon="database">
    CatchAll searches NewsCatcher's continuously updated index of 2+ billion web pages, 
    optimized for finding real-world events (acquisitions, approvals, incidents) 
    within a recent timeframe. The system excels at comprehensive event discovery, 
    not static content retrieval.

      [Write effective queries](/web-search-api/how-to/write-effective-queries).
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Dynamic schemas" icon="flask">
    Each job generates a unique response schema. Field names and structure in 
    the `enrichment` object vary between jobs—even with identical inputs.

    **Guaranteed fields in every record:**
    - `record_id`
    - `record_title`
    - `enrichment` object
    - `citations` array

    **Variable fields:**
    - All fields inside `enrichment` (names, types, structure)

    <Tip>
      See [Understanding dynamic schemas](/web-search-api/guides-and-concepts/dynamic-schemas) 
      for integration patterns.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Customizable extraction" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
    Control what data gets extracted by providing custom validators and enrichments, 
    or let the system generate them automatically based on your query.

    **Custom validators** filter which events are relevant:
    ```json
    {
      "name": "is_acquisition",
      "description": "true if article describes an acquisition",
      "type": "boolean"
    }
    ```

    **Custom enrichments** define what data to extract:
    ```json
    {
      "name": "acquiring_company",
      "description": "Extract the acquiring company name",
      "type": "company"
    }
    ```

    The `company` enrichment type extracts structured data including name, 
    alternative names, website candidates, people, and address.
    
    <Tip>
      Use the [`POST /catchAll/initialize`](/web-search-api/api-reference/endpoints/jobs/initialize-job) endpoint to get suggested validators and 
      enrichments before submitting your job.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Date range controls" icon="calendar">
    Specify custom date ranges for article search, or let the system determine 
    the optimal time window based on your query (default: 5 days).

    Date ranges are validated against your plan's allowed lookback period. 
    If your requested dates exceed plan limits, the API returns a 400 error 
    with specific guidance.
    <Tip>
      Use the [`POST /catchAll/initialize`](/web-search-api/api-reference/endpoints/jobs/initialize-job) 
      endpoint to preview date adjustments before submitting.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Non-deterministic processing" icon="shuffle">
    Identical queries can produce different results:
    - LLMs may generate different keywords, validators, and extractors
    - Different content sources may be retrieved
    - Field names and structure vary between runs
    - Record counts differ
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Asynchronous operation" icon="clock">
    Each query creates a job that processes asynchronously. Use the returned 
    `job_id` to poll the job status and retrieve results when completed. 
    Processing typically takes 10-15 minutes.
    
    Track detailed progress through the [`steps`](/web-search-api/api-reference/endpoints/jobs/get-job-status#response-steps) 
    array in the status endpoint response.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Batch processing" icon="layer-group">
    Results become available progressively during the `enriching` stage as 
    validation completes in batches. Check for `status: "enriching"` to retrieve 
    partial results before job completion.
    
    The `progress_validated` field tracks how many candidate clusters have been 
    processed. This allows you to access early results while the job continues 
    processing remaining batches.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Job continuation" icon="rotate">
    Start with fewer records using the `limit` parameter for quick testing, then use
    [`POST /catchAll/continue`](/web-search-api/api-reference/endpoints/jobs/continue-job) to process more 
    records without re-submitting the query.
    
    Continue requests preserve all analysis, validation, and extraction logic 
    from the original job.
