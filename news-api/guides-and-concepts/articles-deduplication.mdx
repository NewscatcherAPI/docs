## Introduction

Ever feel like you're seeing the same news story over and over? You're not
alone. In today's fast-paced digital world, major events often get covered by
multiple outlets, resulting in a flood of similar articles. This can make it
challenging to find unique, valuable content.

That's where article deduplication comes in. It's a feature we've built into
News API to help you cut through the noise and get to the heart of the news.

## What is article deduplication?

Article deduplication is a process that identifies and filters out nearly
identical news articles from a large collection of content. It's smarter than
simple text matching - it uses advanced language processing to recognize
articles that say the same thing, even if they use different words or
structures.

Here's what article deduplication does:

- Provides you with a diverse set of unique articles.
- Reduces information overload by eliminating redundant content.
- Improves the efficiency of content analysis and research.
- Enhances your experience by presenting a more manageable amount of relevant
  information.

## How does it work?

Our deduplication system uses a multi-step process to accurately identify
duplicate articles while maintaining high precision. Let's break it down:

### Semantic similarity comparison

First, we compare the meaning of articles:

1. We convert article texts into vector representations (embeddings) using our
   Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline.
2. These embeddings capture the meaning and relationships of the content.
3. We use cosine similarity to compare these embeddings, with a threshold of
   0.95 to identify potential duplicates.

This method catches similar articles even if they use different wording or
sentence structures. It's great at identifying rewrites or articles from
different sources covering the same event.

### Levenshtein distance analysis

After the initial screening, we refine our process using the Levenshtein
distance, which measures the minimum number of single-character edits needed to
change one text into another.

We use specific thresholds for accuracy:

- 0.97 for article titles
- 0.92 for article content

This step helps us distinguish between articles that discuss similar topics
differently and those that are true duplicates. It reduces the chance of false
positives in our deduplication process.

### Identifying the original article

Our system doesn't just spot duplicates - it also identifies which article is
likely the original or most authoritative version.

We use a scoring algorithm that considers factors like:

- Domain credibility
- Author's reputation
- Publication timestamp

The article with the highest score becomes the "parent" article. This status can
change if we find a new duplicate with a higher score, reflecting the dynamic
nature of news content.

By identifying the original article, you get access to the most credible and
comprehensive version of a story, while still filtering out redundant content.

### Continuous updates and historical lookup

To keep our deduplication system effective, we continuously update our database
and compare each new article against articles from the past seven days. This
approach catches duplicates that may appear days after the original publication,
accounting for delayed reporting or republishing content.

By implementing this comprehensive process, News API provides you with a
rich, diverse, and non-redundant set of news articles, enhancing the overall
quality and usability of the data.

## How to use deduplication

Now that you understand how article deduplication works, let's look at how to
use this feature in your News API queries.

### Enable deduplication

To exclude duplicate articles from your search results, set the
`exclude_duplicates` parameter to `true` in your API request. Here's what you
need to know:

- The deduplication feature is available only for the
  [Search](/news-api/api-reference/search/search-articles-get) endpoint.
- Deduplication supports
  [all languages available in News API](/news-api/api-reference/enumerated-parameters#language-lang-and-not-lang).

### Understand the API response

When you enable deduplication, each article object in the response includes
additional fields related to duplication:

- `duplicate_count`: The number of duplicates associated with the article.
- `duplicate_articles_group_id`: A unique identifier for the group of duplicates
  associated with the article.

These fields give you valuable information about the extent of duplication for
each article. You can use this data for further analysis or filtering in your
application.

### Code example

Here's an example of how to make a request using Python that includes the
deduplication feature:

```python request.py
import requests
import json

url = "https://v3-api.newscatcherapi.com/api/search"
payload = json.dumps({
  "q": "market value",
  "lang": "en",
  "theme": "Tech",
  "exclude_duplicates": True
})
headers = {
  'x-api-token': 'YOUR-API-KEY',
  'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  'Accept': 'application/json'
}
response = requests.request("POST", url, headers=headers, data=payload)
print(response.text)
```

In the response, you'll find deduplication information for each article. Here's
an example of what you might see:

```json response.json
{
  "title": "Global Financial Services Industry - Insights Around Market Size, Key Trends And Forecast, 2024: Grand View Research, Inc.",
  ...
  "duplicate_count": 5,
  "duplicate_articles_group_id": "542def7ce3844c269d5f1a929309e6da"
}
```

This shows that the article has five duplicates, which have been excluded from
the results due to the `exclude_duplicates` parameter.

## Use cases

Let's explore some key scenarios where deduplication can make a significant
impact:

- **Content curation and aggregation**: Ensure users of your news aggregator see
  a diverse range of articles without redundancy, improving user experience by
  reducing information overload and increasing the variety of perspectives
  presented.
- **Media monitoring and analysis**: Focus on unique brand mentions or industry
  trends without getting overwhelmed by repetitive content, leading to more
  accurate sentiment analysis and trend identification.
- **Research and trend analysis**: Streamline data collection for researchers
  and analysts by eliminating duplicate articles, making it easier to identify
  unique data points and trends for more accurate and efficient analysis.
- **Personalized news feeds**: Enhance user engagement and satisfaction by
  ensuring readers see a wider variety of content rather than multiple versions
  of the same story in their personalized news feeds.

## Deduplication vs clustering

While both deduplication and clustering organize and manage large sets of
articles, they serve different purposes and are used in different contexts.

### Key differences

- **Deduplication** identifies and removes nearly identical articles, preserving
  only the most relevant or original version.
- **Clustering** groups similar articles together without removing any content,
  allowing you to see multiple perspectives on a topic.

### When to use deduplication vs clustering

- Use **deduplication** to eliminate redundancy and present only unique content
  to your users.
- Use **clustering** to group related articles together to show different angles
  or developments of a story over time.
