description: Find articles with related terms in close proximity

## Overview

Proximity search is a powerful technique that lets you find articles where
specific terms appear close to each other. This method is particularly useful to
ensure that related concepts are discussed in the same context within an
article.

News API supports proximity search through the `NEAR` operator. This operator
lets you specify two or more terms and the maximum number of words that can
appear between them.

By using the `NEAR` operator, you can significantly improve the relevance of
your search results, finding articles where related terms are discussed in close
proximity to each other.

## Before you start

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- An active API key for NewsCatcher News API
- Basic knowledge of making API requests
- Python or another tool for making HTTP requests (cURL, Postman, or a
  programming language with HTTP capabilities)

## Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Understand NEAR syntax">

    The `NEAR` operator uses the following format:

    ```
    NEAR("phrase_A", "phrase_B", distance, in_order);
    ```

    - `phrase_A` and `phrase_B`: The terms or phrases you want to find near each
      other (max 4 words per phrase).
    - `distance`: The maximum number of words that can appear between the phrases
      (max 100).
    - `in_order`: Optional boolean parameter. If true, `phrase_B` must appear
      after `phrase_A`. Defaults to false.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Construct your query">

    Here are some examples of `NEAR` queries:

    - `NEAR("climate change", "renewable energy", 15)`
    - `NEAR("artificial intelligence", "healthcare", 20, true)`

    Note the following limitations:

    - Maximum 4 words per phrase
    - Maximum 3 phrases per `NEAR` operation
    - Maximum distance of 100 words

  </Step>
  <Step title="Make an API request">

    Use the `/search` endpoint with your constructed query in the `q` parameter.
    Here's a Python code example:

    ```python
    import requests
    import json

    API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
    URL = "https://v3-api.newscatcherapi.com/api/search"
    HEADERS = {"x-api-token": API_KEY}

    PAYLOAD = {
        "q": 'NEAR("climate change", "renewable energy", 15)',
        "lang": "en",
    }

    try:
        response = requests.post(URL, headers=HEADERS, json=PAYLOAD)
        response.raise_for_status()
        print(json.dumps(response.json(), indent=2))
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"Failed to fetch articles: {e}")
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Analyze the results">

    The API returns a JSON response similar to other search queries. Here's an
    example of what you might see:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "total_hits": 635,
  "page": 1,
  "total_pages": 7,
  "page_size": 100,
  "articles": [
    {
      "title": "We Must Adopt Renewable Energy To Combat Climate Change",
      "author": null,
      "published_date": "2024-09-01",
      "link": "https://ournaijanews.com/we-must-adopt-renewable-energy-to-combat-climate-change-sanusi",
      "domain_url": "ournaijanews.com",
      "description": "Emir Sanusi II advocates for renewable energy adoption to combat climate change, emphasizing its importance for environmental and human health.",
      "word_count": 453
      // ... other article fields
    }
    // ... other articles
  ],
  "user_input": {
    "q": "NEAR(\"climate change\", \"renewable energy\", 15)",
    "lang": ["en"],
    "from_": "2024-08-26T00:00:00",
    "to_": "2024-09-02T10:32:59.545085",
    "sort_by": "relevancy",
    "page": 1,
    "page_size": 100
    // ... other input parameters
  }
}
```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Refine your query as needed">

    If you're not getting the desired results, try adjusting your query:

    - Change the distance parameter to narrow or broaden your search
    - Add more terms to the `NEAR` operator (up to 3 phrases)
    - Combine `NEAR` with boolean operators for more complex queries. For example:

    ```
    NEAR("electric vehicles", "battery technology", 20) AND NOT "Tesla"
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>
