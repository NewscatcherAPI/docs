  Efficiently retrieve and process large volumes of news data using pagination
  in News API

## Overview

When working with large datasets in News API, pagination is essential for
efficiently retrieving and processing news articles. Pagination allows you to
break down large result sets into smaller, manageable chunks, improving
performance and reducing the load on both the client and server.

News API uses a cursor-based pagination system, which is ideal for handling
large, dynamic datasets. This guide will walk you through the process of
implementing pagination in your API requests.

## Before you start

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- An active API key for NewsCatcher News API
- Basic knowledge of making API requests
- Python or another tool for making HTTP requests (e.g., cURL, Postman, or a
  programming language with HTTP capabilities)

Pagination is available on the following endpoints:

- [Search](/v3/api-reference/endpoints/search/search-articles-get)
- [Latest headlines](/v3/api-reference/endpoints/latest-headlines/retrieve-latest-headlines-get)
- [Authors](/v3/api-reference/endpoints/authors/search-articles-by-author-get)
- [Search by link](/v3/api-reference/endpoints/search-by-link/search-articles-by-links-or-ids-get)
- [Search similar](/v3/api-reference/endpoints/search-similar/search-similar-articles-get)
- [Aggregation](/v3/api-reference/endpoints/aggregation/get-aggregation-count-by-interval-get)

<Note>
  A single API response cannot return more than 1000 articles, so you should use
  pagination to retrieve larger datasets.
</Note>

## Steps

<Steps>
<Step title="Understand pagination parameters">

News API uses two main parameters for pagination:

- `page`: The page number you want to retrieve (default is 1, starts from 1).
- `page_size`: The number of results per page (default is 100, range is 1 to
  1000).

</Step>

<Step title="Construct your initial query">

Start by setting up your basic query with pagination parameters. For example:

```json
{
  "q": "artificial intelligence",
  "lang": "en",
  "page": 1,
  "page_size": 100
}
```

</Step>
<Step title="Make the first API request">

Here's a Python example demonstrating the initial request:

```python request.py
import requests
import json

# Configuration
API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
URL = "https://v3-api.newscatcherapi.com/api/search"
HEADERS = {"x-api-token": API_KEY}

PAYLOAD = {"q": "artificial intelligence", "lang": "en", "page": 1, "page_size": 100}

try:
    response = requests.post(URL, headers=HEADERS, json=PAYLOAD)
    response.raise_for_status()
    data = response.json()
    if "total_pages" not in data or "articles" not in data:
        print(f"Unexpected response format: {data}")
    else:
        print(json.dumps(data, indent=2))
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    print(f"Failed to fetch articles: {e}, Status code: {response.status_code if response else 'N/A'}")
```

</Step>
<Step title="Analyze the pagination-related information in the response">

The API response includes several fields related to pagination:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "total_hits": 10000,
  "page": 1,
  "total_pages": 100,
  "page_size": 100
}
```

- `total_hits`: The total number of articles matching your query.
- `page`: The current page number.
- `total_pages`: The total number of pages available.
- `page_size`: The number of articles per page.

</Step>

<Step title="Implement pagination logic">

To retrieve all pages, you'll need to loop through them. Here's an example of
how to do this with enhanced error handling and exponential backoff:

```python paginate.py
import requests
import time
import random

API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
URL = "https://v3-api.newscatcherapi.com/api/search"
HEADERS = {"x-api-token": API_KEY}

PAYLOAD = {
    "q": "artificial intelligence",
    "lang": "en",
    "page_size": 1000,  # Example with larger page size
}

def exponential_backoff(retries):
    time.sleep((2**retries) + random.uniform(0, 1))

def fetch_all_pages():
    all_articles = []
    page = 1
    total_pages = None
    retries = 0
    max_retries = 5

    while total_pages is None or page <= total_pages:
        PAYLOAD["page"] = page
        try:
            response = requests.post(URL, headers=HEADERS, json=PAYLOAD)
            response.raise_for_status()
            data = response.json()

            if "total_pages" not in data or "articles" not in data:
                print(f"Unexpected response format on page {page}: {data}")
                break

            # Use the total_pages directly from the API response
            if total_pages is None:
                total_pages = data["total_pages"]

            all_articles.extend(data["articles"])
            print(f"Fetched page {page} of {total_pages}")

            if page >= total_pages:
                break

            page += 1
            time.sleep(1)  # Respect rate limits
            retries = 0  # Reset retries after a successful request

        except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
            print(f"Failed to fetch page {page}: {e}")
            retries += 1
            if retries >= max_retries:
                print("Max retries reached, aborting.")
                break
            exponential_backoff(retries)

    return all_articles

articles = fetch_all_pages()
print(f"Total articles fetched: {len(articles)}")
```

</Step>
</Steps>

## Optimize requests

To efficiently fetch large datasets while respecting API rate limits, use the
following strategies:

- Add delays between requests, such as a fixed sleep time, or implement an
  exponential backoff strategy for retries in case of failures (as shown in the
  previous example).
- Fetch data in manageable batches to avoid memory issues with large datasets.
- Use multithreading or asynchronous functions to speed up the process while
  respecting API subscription limits.

Here is an example of asynchronous requests using `aiohttp` with concurrency, a
retry mechanism, and logging:

```python paginate_async.py
import aiohttp
import asyncio
import os
import logging
import json
from typing import Dict, List, Optional, Any
from tqdm.asyncio import tqdm

# Constants
API_KEY: str = os.getenv("NEWSCATCHER_API_KEY")
if not API_KEY:
    raise EnvironmentError("API key not set in environment variables")

URL: str = "https://v3-api.newscatcherapi.com/api/search"
HEADERS: Dict[str, str] = {"x-api-token": API_KEY}
PAYLOAD: Dict[str, Any] = {
    "q": "artificial intelligence",
    "lang": "en",
    "page_size": 100,
}
MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS: int = 5  # Set the desired number of concurrent requests
MAX_RETRIES: int = 3  # Number of retries for failed requests
TIMEOUT: int = 30  # Timeout for each request in seconds
OUTPUT_FILE: str = "fetched_articles.json"

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format="%(asctime)s [%(levelname)s] %(message)s",
    handlers=[
        logging.FileHandler("fetch_articles.log"),  # Log to a file
        logging.StreamHandler(),  # Also log to console
    ],
)


async def fetch_page(
    session: aiohttp.ClientSession,
    url: str,
    headers: Dict[str, str],
    payload: Dict[str, Any],
    timeout: int = TIMEOUT,
    max_retries: int = MAX_RETRIES,
) -> Optional[Dict]:
    """Fetch a single page with retry logic."""
    retries: int = 0
    while retries < max_retries:
        try:
            async with session.post(
                url, headers=headers, json=payload, timeout=timeout
            ) as response:
                response.raise_for_status()
                return await response.json()
        except aiohttp.ClientResponseError as e:
            retries += 1
        except aiohttp.ClientConnectionError:
            retries += 1
        except asyncio.TimeoutError:
            retries += 1
        except aiohttp.ClientError as e:

    return None  # Explicitly return None if all retries fail


async def fetch_page_with_semaphore(

    url: str,
    headers: Dict[str, str],
    payload: Dict[str, Any],
) -> Optional[Dict]:
    """Fetch a page using a semaphore to limit concurrent requests."""
    async with semaphore:
        return await fetch_page(session, url, headers, payload)


async def fetch_all_pages_concurrently(
    url: str,
    headers: Dict[str, str],
    initial_payload: Dict[str, Any],
    max_concurrent_requests: int = MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS,
) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """Fetch all pages concurrently using a semaphore to limit the number of requests."""
    semaphore: asyncio.Semaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(max_concurrent_requests)
    all_articles: List[Dict[str, Any]] = []

    async with aiohttp.ClientSession(
        connector=aiohttp.TCPConnector(limit=10)
    ) as session:
        # Fetch the first page to determine the total number of pages
        async with semaphore:
            initial_payload["page"] = 1
            data: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = await fetch_page(
                session, url, headers, initial_payload
            )

            if not data or "total_pages" not in data or "articles" not in data:
                return []

            total_pages: int = data["total_pages"]
            all_articles.extend(data["articles"])

        # Prepare tasks for fetching all remaining pages
        tasks: List[asyncio.Task] = []
        for page in range(2, total_pages + 1):
            payload: Dict[str, Any] = initial_payload.copy()
            payload["page"] = page
            task: asyncio.Task = fetch_page_with_semaphore(
                semaphore, session, url, headers, payload
            )
            tasks.append(
                asyncio.wait_for(task, timeout=60)
            )  # Increased timeout for tasks

        # Execute all tasks concurrently and gather results with tqdm progress bar
        results: List[Optional[Dict[str, Any]]] = await tqdm.gather(
            *tasks, desc="Fetching pages", unit="page", initial=1, total=total_pages
        )

        # Process results
        for result in results:
            if result and "articles" in result:
                all_articles.extend(result["articles"])

    return all_articles


def main() -> None:
    """Main function to execute pagination and fetch all articles."""
    # Fetch all articles
    articles: List[Dict[str, Any]] = asyncio.run(
        fetch_all_pages_concurrently(URL, HEADERS, PAYLOAD, MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS)
    )

    # Save fetched data to a JSON file
    with open(OUTPUT_FILE, "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
        json.dump(articles, f, ensure_ascii=False, indent=2)

    logging.info(f"Total articles fetched: {len(articles)}")
    logging.info(f"Data saved to {OUTPUT_FILE}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Best practices

- Use smaller page sizes (e.g., 20-50) for faster initial load times in user
  interfaces.
- Use larger page sizes (up to 1000) for batch processing or to retrieve the
  entire dataset.
- Be aware that the dataset may change between requests, especially for queries
  on recent news.
- Implement error handling and retries to make your pagination code more robust.
- Consider implementing a way to resume pagination from a specific page in case
  of interruptions.
- When using multithreading or async functions, carefully manage concurrency to
  stay within your API usage limits.
