# Introduction

News API provides a flexible way to access a comprehensive database of news
articles from around the world. With v3, you get more control over your queries
and richer data in your responses. Whether you're building news apps, training
language models, or analyzing media trends, News API helps you work efficiently
with large-scale news data.

## Key features

- Advanced querying with boolean operators and proximity search
- NLP-enriched content
- Articles clustering and deduplication
- Multi-language support
- High volume data retrieval (up to 1000 articles per request)

## Base URL

All API requests must be sent to the following base URL:

```bash
https://v3-api.newscatcherapi.com/api
```

## Endpoints

NewsCatcher News API provides the following key endpoints:

1. `/search`: Find relevant articles using keywords, publish date, language,
   country, and more.
2. `/latest_headlines`: Retrieve news articles for a specific period, filtered
   by country, language, topic, or sources.
3. `/breaking_news`: Retrieves breaking news articles and sorts them based on
   specified criteria.
4. `/authors`: Locate articles written by specific authors or journalists.
5. `/search_by_link`: Find articles that mention specific URLs or domains.
6. `/sources`: Check available media outlets with the source language, country,
   name, and URL.
7. `/aggregation_count`: Get aggregated article counts based on language,
   country, source, publish date, and more.
8. `/subscription`: Access details about your API subscription, including plan
   limits and usage statistics.

All endpoints support `GET` and `POST` methods for flexible integration into
your applications.
