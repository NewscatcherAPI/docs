---

This guide explains how to effectively report bugs and issues with the
NewsCatcher APIs to ensure quick resolution and improve your experience.

## Before reporting

Before submitting a bug report, please take these steps to ensure efficient
resolution:

1. **Check documentation**: Review the [API Reference](/news-api/api-reference/search/search-articles-post) to
   verify you're using parameters correctly and that you understand expected
   behaviors.

2. **Verify API usage**: Double-check that you're using the correct headers,
   parameters, and payload formats according to our documentation.

3. **Check status page**: Visit our
   [status page](https://status.newscatcherapi.com) to see if there are any
   known issues or maintenance activities affecting the service.

4. **Try our debugging tools**: Use our
   [Postman collections](https://www.postman.com/newscatcherapi/newscatcher-public-workspace/overview)
   or the API playground in our documentation to verify if the issue can be
   reproduced with different tools.

5. **Examine your code**: Double-check your implementation to ensure the issue
   isn't in your integration code.

<Tip>
  Many reported "bugs" turn out to be integration issues that can be resolved
  through proper configuration or implementation. Testing with Postman often
  helps identify these cases quickly.
</Tip>

## Where to report bugs

You can report bugs through the following official channels:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card
    title="Customer Portal"
    icon="ticket"
    href="https://support.newscatcherapi.com/customer-portal"
  >
    Our preferred channel for bug reports with structured templates and ticket
    tracking
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Email Support"
    icon="envelope"
    href="mailto:support@newscatcherapi.com"
  >
    Alternative channel for bug reports and general support
  </Card>
  <Card title="Dedicated Slack" icon="slack">
    For eligible customers with dedicated Slack channel access (based on plan
    tier)
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="GitHub Issues"
    icon="github"
    href="https://github.com/Newscatcher"
  >
    Review the current issues and open a new one if needed (for SDK-related bugs
    only)
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
  Our Customer Portal is the recommended channel as it automatically creates
  tickets in our internal tracking system, allowing for faster processing and
  resolution.
</Info>

## How to report effectively

When reporting a bug, include the following information to help us identify and
fix the issue quickly:

### 1. Include the correlation ID

<Info>
  Every API response includes a unique `correlation-id` in the headers. This ID
  is essential for us to trace your request through our system.
</Info>

Here's how to find it:

<CodeGroup>

    ```bash Terminal
    curl -i https://api.newscatcherapi.com/v3/search
    # Look for: correlation-id: 2697cebe-6f5c-46e0-9b99-81e8abe55522
    ```

    ```javascript JavaScript
    // After making a request
    console.log(response.headers.get("correlation-id"));
    ```

    ```python Python
    # After making a request
    print(response.headers['correlation-id'])
    ```

</CodeGroup>

### 2. What happened vs. what you expected

Briefly describe:

- What you were trying to do
- What actually happened
- What you expected to happen instead

### 3. Request and response details

Provide information to reporoduce the issue:

- API endpoint and method (`GET`/`POST`)
- Request parameters or payload
- Error message and status code

### 4. Bug report template

For convenience, you can use our template when reporting bugs:

```
## Bug Description
[Brief description of the issue]

## Correlation ID
correlation-id: [ID from response headers]

## Request Details
- Endpoint: [e.g., /v3/search]
- Method: [GET/POST]
- Parameters/Body: [Key details]

## Response
- Status Code: [e.g., 500]
- Error Message: [If applicable]

## Expected Behavior
[What you expected to happen]

## Environment
- Language/SDK: [e.g., Python 3.9, newscatcher-python 1.2.0]
```

<Tip>If possible, attach relevant screenshots that show the issue.</Tip>

## Common issues and solutions

Before reporting a bug, check if your issue matches one of these common
scenarios:

### Using incorrect authentication header

We use `x-api-token` for authentication, not `x-api-key`:

<CodeGroup>
```http Correct
GET /v3/search HTTP/1.1
Host: api.newscatcherapi.com
x-api-token: YOUR_API_KEY
```

```http Incorrect
GET /v3/search HTTP/1.1
Host: api.newscatcherapi.com
x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY
```

</CodeGroup>

### Malformed JSON payload causing 500 errors

If you receive a `500 Internal Server Error`, check your request payload:

<CodeGroup>
```json Correct
{
  "q": "bitcoin",
  "from_": "30d",
  "countries": ["US", "CA"]
}
```

```json Incorrect
{
  "q": "bitcoin",
  "from_": "30d",
  "countries": ["US", "CA"  // Missing closing bracket
}
```

</CodeGroup>

<Info>
  For security reasons, our API may return a generic 500 error for certain
  malformed payloads instead of detailed validation errors. Always validate your
  JSON before sending.
</Info>

## What happens after you report a bug?

1. **Ticket creation**: Your report is converted into a ticket in our internal
   tracking system.

2. **Initial assessment**: Our support team performs an initial assessment to
   determine severity and priority.

3. **Investigation**: Our engineering team uses the correlation ID to trace the
   issue through our logs and systems.

4. **Status updates**: We'll keep you informed about the progress of your bug
   report through the same channel you used to report it.

5. **Resolution**: Once resolved, we'll provide you with details about the fix
   and when you can expect it to be deployed.

## Issue priority and response times

When you report a bug, our support team evaluates its priority based on urgency
and impact. Knowing these levels helps you set expectations for response and
resolution times.

### How we determine priority

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Urgency" icon="fire">
    How quickly the issue needs to be addressed based on its effect on your
    operations
  </Card>
  <Card title="Impact" icon="chart-network">
    The scope and severity of the issue on the service functionality
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Priority levels

| Priority   | Description                                                                | Target Response Time | Target Resolution Time |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Priority 1 | Critical issue causing complete service unavailability with no workaround  | 1 hour               | Within 12 hours        |
| Priority 2 | Significant issue with major impact; service usable but seriously impaired | 4 hours              | 2 business days        |
| Priority 3 | Moderate issue with acceptable workarounds available                       | 12 hours             | 5 business days        |
| Priority 4 | Minor issue with minimal impact                                            | 1 business day       | Planned                |

<Info>
  Priority 1 issues should be reported by phone in addition to creating a ticket
  to ensure immediate attention. Standard support hours are 8am–5pm on business
  days in your principal location.
</Info>

When reporting a bug, you can suggest a priority level based on the criteria
above, but the final determination will be made by our support team based on
technical assessment.
