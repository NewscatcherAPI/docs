title: Search By Date & Time
description: Learn how to filter your search results by their publication date and time
---
While searching for news articles you'll often need to filter out the results by their publication date. The articles returned by our News API have their publication date and time as an attribute : `published_date`. Using this information you can further drill down in your search queries on the [`v2/search`](https://docs.newscatcherapi.com/api-docs/endpoints/search-news) and [`v2/latest_headlines`](https://docs.newscatcherapi.com/api-docs/endpoints/latest-headlines) endpoints.

`/search`
-------------

The `/search` endpoint has two parameters, `to` and `from`, that enable you to filter your news search results by their publication dates.

Let's say, you want to understand the general perception of the new Tesla UI update. To achieve this you'll need to fetch the articles published around the time the update was pushed to the cars. If you decide on the date range of _2021/12/01_ to _2022/31/01,_ you would use the `to` and `from` parameters to make a request like_:_

```
curl -XGET 'https://api.newscatcherapi.com/v2/search?lang=en&from=2021/12/01&q=Tesla%20AND%20UI&to=2022/01/31' -H 'x-api-key: your_key_1'
```

<Info>
The default timezone for the **_`to`_** and **_`from`_** parameters is UTC.

Which would yield articles such as:

With bug fixes and incremental improvements, however, iOS 7 was improved and its new look and interface were eventually welcomed by Apple's mobile users. With more driver-friendly optimizations, perhaps Tesla's V11 UI could also go down a similar path.  Don't hesitate to contact us with news tips.

### Search Using Phrases

You can use simple phrases like '_three months ago'_ and _'6 weeks ago'_ instead of specifying the date & time explicitly. For example, _'Tesla UI'_ related news articles can be searched as follows:

```
curl -XGET 'https://api.newscatcherapi.com/v2/search?lang=en&from=three%20months%20ago&q=Tesla%20AND%20UI&to=6%20weeks%20ago' -H 'x-api-key: your_key_1'
```

Querying with phrases returns a slightly different set of news articles, this is because our simple phrases aren't as granular as using specific dates. It's hard to precisely look for a complex time period time. For instance, it's easier to simply use the date `_2021/07/18_`_,_ as opposed to `'7 months and 27 days ago'`. And if you want to specify the time, things get even more complicated.
<Info>
If you want to learn how to make more detailed queries using date/time phrases, check out the [_dateparser_](https://dateparser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) module docs.
</Info>
Also, the phrases are relative to the time of the request. Therefore, if you make a query using phrases today, and use it to fetch news articles again next week, you'll get different results. On the other hand, if you use the dates you'll get the same set of news articles.

### Making Better Queries

The _'Tesla UI'_ search query is very specific so the number of results isn't that high. But if you were to make a similar search for a broader term like '_Apple_', you would run into the API result limit of 10,000 articles:

```
curl -XGET 'https://api.newscatcherapi.com/v2/search?q=Apple&lang=en&from=2021/12/01&to=2022/31/01' -H 'x-api-key: your_key_1'
```

            "clean_url": "screenrant.com",
            "excerpt": "Apple TV+ is on many TVs, but signup is tricky.",
            "summary": "Apple TV+ is available on many non-Apple devices, but signing up can be tricky without a verified Apple ID. Here's the workaround using only Android. \nApple TV+ is slowly but steadily expanding its catalog of available shows, making its $4.99 monthly subscription fee look more appealing. With successful original series like Ted Lasso and Dickinson backed by high production value, some TV and movie lovers find the subscription service a must-have. Although Apple TV+ is available on many devices, signing up can be tricky without a validated Apple ID. The company offers the option to create an Apple ID online but doesn't allow it to be used with Apple TV+ until setting up an Apple device. Not to worry, because there is a workaround using only an Android device. The Apple TV+ subscription service was one of the first announced, second to Apple Music, in the company's shift towards a subscription model. Apple initially offered a combination of different services separately — additional iCloud storage, Apple Music, and Apple News — as the company added more services, it consolidated its offerings. Now, the family plan is called iCloud Plus and offers all of the benefits of the Apple ecosystem. But where does that leave Android users intrigued by the Apple TV+ catalog but outside the Apple ecosystem? The process is simple to watch Apple TV+ in a web browser. Go to the Apple TV+ website, and users can create an Apple ID and enter payment information to subscribe to the streaming service. However, if the goal is to connect an Apple TV+ account to a smart TV or a set-top box, creating an online account won't be enough to complete the setup process. Additionally, while the Apple TV+ app is a matured evolution of iTunes on iOS, macOS and TVOS, it is relatively primitive on the website, offering a subpar experience.\nUse Apple Music To Validate An Apple ID \n \n\n\n While Apple TV+ doesn't currently offer an Android app, it recently added its Apple Music app to Android. That means users can use the Apple Music app, found on the Google Play store, to validate their Apple ID for use on other devices. Thankfully, since Apple Music offers a free trial and the option to create an Apple ID, users can quickly validate their accounts. Simply download the Apple Music app for Android, follow the prompts to make or enter an existing Apple ID, and subscribe to the free trial. Users can cancel the free trial immediately after signing up to protect against accidental charges. After users complete the process, their Apple ID will be 'cleared' by Apple's servers for use on smart TVs and set-top boxes. Though Apple has made it increasingly difficult for users outside of its ecosystem, this solution offers a simple way to create an Apple ID and subscribe to Apple TV+ with just an Android device. After everything is set up, the Apple TV+ account will function as part of the iCloud system, allowing users to sign in to other devices normally. That means users can use the devices they might already own — like an Xbox, Amazon Fire TV, Roku, or Playstation — instead of forcing users to purchase an Apple TV or an Apple device. In the future, it's possible Apple could add its entire catalog of subscription services to non-Apple devices as the company did with Apple Music as it gained popularity.

To work around this limit, it's recommended to break down your query time intervals into smaller chunks of time like a month, a fortnight, a week, or even a day depending on the query. In the case of the previous _'Apple'_ query, you will need to break it down into individual days to fetch all the results for the two month time period:

```
curl -XGET 'https://api.newscatcherapi.com/v2/search?q=Apple&lang=en&from=2021/12/01&to=2021/12/02' -H 'x-api-key: your_key_1
```


```
curl -XGET 'https://api.newscatcherapi.com/v2/search?q=Apple&lang=en&from=2021/12/02&to=2021/12/03' -H 'x-api-key: your_key_1
```


```
curl -XGET 'https://api.newscatcherapi.com/v2/search?q=Apple&lang=en&from=2021/12/03&to=2021/12/04' -H 'x-api-key: your_key_1
```


and so on.

### Date Precision

One thing to keep in mind when searching by date is the `published_date_precision` attribute. There are three types of date precision defined in our News API:

1.  **`"full"`** — day and time of an article is correctly identified with the appropriate timezone
    
2.  **`"timezone unknown"`** — day and time of an article is correctly identified without timezone
    
3.  **`"date"`** — only the day is identified without an exact time
    

The date and time of all articles with full precision is converted into UTC. And all articles without the timezone information are treated as if they are published in the UTC timezone. This may cause some minor issues but the percentage of articles without the timezone information is tiny and it's only becoming smaller.

<Frame caption="Distribution of `published_date_precision` attribute">![](/images/date-time.png)</Frame>

`/latest_headlines`
-----------------------

The `/latest_headlines` endpoint doesn't have the `to` and `from` parameters. Instead, it has the `when` parameter that dictates the time period starting from which you want to get the articles for. It accepts two forms:

1.  Daily Form `Xd` `7d` => last 7 days time period
    
2.  Hourly Form `Xh` `24h` => last 12 hours
    

So an API request for the articles in the last twelve hours `12h` will yield more and older results than a request for articles from the last one hour `1h`.

```
curl -XGET 'https://api.newscatcherapi.com/v2/latest_headlines?countries=US&topic=business&when=12h' -H 'x-api-key: your_key_1
```
