Use the CatchAll community node to integrate structured web research directly
into your n8n automation workflows.

## Before you start

- n8n instance (cloud or self-hosted)
- CatchAll API key (obtain from
  [platform.newscatcherapi.com](https://platform.newscatcherapi.com))

## Install community node

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open community nodes settings">
    Navigate to **Settings → Community Nodes** in your n8n instance.
  </Step>

<Step title="Install the CatchAll node">
  Enter the package name: ``` n8n-nodes-newscatcher-catchall-pernode ``` Click
  **Install** and wait for the installation to complete.
</Step>

  <Step title="Verify installation">
    Create a new workflow and search for "Newscatcher" in the node panel. The CatchAll node should appear in your available nodes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Configure credentials

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add CatchAll credentials">
    In any workflow, add the **Newscatcher CatchAll** node. Click the **Credential to connect with** dropdown and select **Create New Credentials**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter your API key">
    Paste your CatchAll API key into the credential field and click **Save**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Credentials are stored securely in your n8n instance and reused across
  workflows.
</Note>

## Create your first workflow

This example submits a CatchAll job, polls for completion, and retrieves
results:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Submit a job">
    Add a **Newscatcher CatchAll** node with these settings:
    
    - **Operation**: Submit Job
    - **Query**: `Tech company earnings this quarter`
    - **Context**: `Focus on revenue and profit margins`
    - **Schema**: `Company [NAME] earned [REVENUE] in [QUARTER]`
    
    The node outputs the `job_id` for the next step.
  </Step>

<Step title="Wait for job completion">
  Add a **Wait** node set to 10 minutes. CatchAll jobs typically complete in
  10-15 minutes.
</Step>

  <Step title="Check job status">
    Add another **Newscatcher CatchAll** node:
    
    - **Operation**: Job Status
    - **Job ID**: `{{ $json.job_id }}` (from Submit Job node)
    
    Connect this to a **Loop** that polls every 60 seconds until the status shows `completed` in the `steps` array.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Pull results">
    Add a final **Newscatcher CatchAll** node:
    
    - **Operation**: Pull Job Results
    - **Job ID**: `{{ $json.job_id }}`
    
    This returns structured records with the `enrichment` object containing extracted data.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Field names in the `enrichment` object vary between jobs. See [Dynamic
  schemas](/v3/catch-all/overview/dynamic-schemas) for handling variable
  response structures.
</Warning>

## Common workflows

### Research automation

Automatically research companies and export to your CRM:

1. **Trigger**: Schedule (daily at 9 AM)
2. **CatchAll**: Submit job with company query
3. **Wait**: 10 minutes
4. **CatchAll**: Pull results
5. **Transform**: Map fields to CRM format
6. **CRM Node**: Create/update records

### Scheduled monitoring

Set up recurring research with webhook notifications:

1. **CatchAll**: Create monitor with webhook URL
2. **Webhook Trigger**: Listen for completion
3. **CatchAll**: Pull monitor results when triggered
4. **Process**: Transform and route data
5. **Notification**: Send summary to Slack/email

### Multi-source enrichment

Combine CatchAll with other data sources:

1. **Spreadsheet**: Load list of companies
2. **Loop**: For each company
3. **CatchAll**: Submit research job
4. **Wait**: For completion
5. **CatchAll**: Pull results
6. **Merge**: Combine with existing data
7. **Spreadsheet**: Write enriched data

## Troubleshooting

### Node not found after installation

**Solution**: Restart your n8n instance. For self-hosted installations, restart
the Docker container or service.

### API key not recognized

**Symptom**: 403 Forbidden error

**Solution**: Verify your API key is active in the
[platform dashboard](https://platform.newscatcherapi.com). Create new
credentials if needed.

### Job takes too long

**Symptom**: Job doesn't complete after 20 minutes

**Solution**: Check job status using the **Job Status** operation. If stuck in a
processing stage, contact support with the `job_id`.

### Empty enrichment object

**Symptom**: Results return but `enrichment` contains no fields

**Solution**: The query may be too broad or no matching content was found. Try
refining your query with more specific context.
