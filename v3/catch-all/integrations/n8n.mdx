Use the CatchAll community node to integrate CatchAll API into your n8n workflows.

## Before you start

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- n8n instance (Cloud or self-hosted)
- CatchAll API key (obtain from
  [platform.newscatcherapi.com](https://platform.newscatcherapi.com))

## Install community node

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="n8n Cloud">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Open nodes panel">
        In any workflow, click **`+`** or press **Tab** to open the nodes panel.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Search for node">
        In the search field, type "Newscatcher CatchAll".
      </Step>

      <Step title="Install from search results">
        Click on the **Newscatcher CatchAll** node that appears in search results, then click **Install**.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Wait for installation">
        Installation takes a few seconds. Once complete, the node is available to add to your workflows.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    <Note>
      If the node doesn't appear in search, it may not yet be available on Cloud. Use a [self-hosted n8n instance](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/installation/) as an alternative.
    </Note>

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Self-hosted">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Navigate to Community nodes">
        In your self-hosted n8n instance, go to **Settings > Community nodes**.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Install package">
        Click **Install a community node** and enter package details:

        - **npm Package Name**: `n8n-nodes-newscatcher-catchall-pernode`.
        - Check: "I understand the risks of installing unverified code from a public source".
        - Click **Install.**
      </Step>

      <Step title="Wait for installation">
        Installation takes a few seconds. Once complete, the node is available to add to your workflows.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Configure API key

Enter your API key directly in each node's **API Key** field. There is no shared
credentials dropdown.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add CatchAll node">
    In the nodes panel, search for "Newscatcher CatchAll" and add it to your workflow.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter API key">
    In the **Parameters** tab, paste your CatchAll API key into the **API Key** field.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Available operations

The CatchAll node supports three operations:

| Operation  | Description                    | Endpoint                      |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| `Submit` | Create a new CatchAll job        | `/catchAll/submit `           |
| `Status` | Check job processing progress    | `/catchAll/status/{job_id}`   |
| `Pull`   | Retrieve completed job results   | `/catchAll/pull/{job_id}`     |

<Warning>
  Monitor operations and other advanced features are not available in the
  community node. Use the CatchAll API directly via HTTP Request nodes for
  monitor functionality.
</Warning>

## Create your first workflow

This workflow submits a CatchAll job, polls until completion, and retrieves
results.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add trigger">
    Add a **When clicking 'Execute workflow'** trigger node to start the workflow manually.
  </Step>

<Step title="Submit job">
  Add a **Newscatcher CatchAll** node with these settings: 
  
    - **API Key**: Your CatchAll API key 
    - **Operation**: `Submit` 
    - **Query**: Natural language question describing what to find. 
    - **Context** (optional):  Additional context to focus on specific aspects of your query.
    - **Schema** (optional): Template string to guide record summary formatting.
  
   This outputs a `job_id` for the next steps.
</Step>

  <Step title="Check job status">
    Add another **Newscatcher CatchAll** node:
    
    - **API Key**: Your CatchAll API key
    - **Operation**: `Status`
    - **Job ID**: `{{ $json.job_id }}`
    
    This returns the current processing status with a `steps` array.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add node for polling">
    Add an **If** node to check if the job is complete:
    
    **Condition**:
    ```javascript
    {{ $json.steps[5].completed || $json.steps[6].completed }}
    ```
    **Set to:** `is true`
    
    This checks if either:
    - Step 6 (status: "completed") is done > job succeeded
    - Step 7 (status: "failed") is done > job failed
  </Step>

<Step title="Add Wait node (False branch)">
  Connect the **False** output of the **If** node to a **Wait** node:

  - **Resume**: After Time Interval 
  - **Wait Time**: 30 seconds 
  
  Then connect the **Wait** node back to the **Get job status** node to create a polling loop.
</Step>

  <Step title="Pull results (True branch)">
    Connect the **True** output of the **If** node to a final **Newscatcher CatchAll** node:  
    - **API Key**: Your CatchAll API key
    - **Operation**: `Pull`
    - **Job ID**: `{{ $('Create a job').item.json.job_id }}`
    
    This retrieves the structured records with citations.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  Jobs typically complete in 10-15 minutes. The polling loop checks status every
  30 seconds. Adjust the wait time based on your needs (30-60 seconds
  recommended).
</Info>
