description: Connect CatchAll to Make.com scenarios for automated web research
---

Use the CatchAll custom app to integrate structured web research directly into
your Make.com automation scenarios.

## Before you start

- Make.com account
- CatchAll API key (obtain from
  [platform.newscatcherapi.com](https://platform.newscatcherapi.com))
- Access to the CatchAll custom app in Make.com

## Configure connection

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add CatchAll to your scenario">
    Create a new scenario and search for "Newscatcher CatchAll" in the module search. Add any CatchAll module to your scenario.
  </Step>

<Step title="Create connection">
  Click **Create a connection** when prompted. Enter a connection name (e.g.,
  "CatchAll Production").
</Step>

<Step title="Enter API key">
  Paste your CatchAll API key into the **API Key** field and click **Save**.
</Step>

  <Step title="Verify connection">
    The connection is now available for all CatchAll modules in your scenarios.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Create your first scenario

This example submits a CatchAll job, polls for completion, and processes
results:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add Submit Job module">
    Add the **Submit Job** module with these settings:
    
    - **Query**: `Tech company earnings this quarter`
    - **Context**: `Focus on revenue and profit margins`
    - **Schema**: `Company [NAME] earned [REVENUE] in [QUARTER]`
    
    The module outputs the `job_id` for subsequent modules.
  </Step>

<Step title="Add Repeater for polling">
  Add a **Repeater** module set to repeat 15 times with 60-second intervals
  between iterations.
</Step>

<Step title="Check job status">
  Inside the Repeater, add the **Check Status** module: - **Job ID**: Map the
  `job_id` from the Submit Job module This checks if the job has reached
  `completed` status in the `steps` array.
</Step>

<Step title="Add Break condition">
  Configure the Repeater to break when any step in the `steps` array has
  `status` equal to `completed` and `completed` is `true`.
</Step>

  <Step title="Pull results">
    After the Repeater, add the **Pull Job Data** module:
    
    - **Job ID**: Map the `job_id` from Submit Job
    - **Page**: 1
    - **Page Size**: 100
    
    This returns structured records with source citations.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Field names in the `enrichment` object vary between jobs. See [Dynamic
  schemas](/v3/catch-all/overview/dynamic-schemas) for handling variable
  response structures.
</Warning>

## Common scenarios

### Automated company research

Research companies on a schedule and export to your CRM:

1. **Schedule Trigger**: Daily at 9 AM
2. **Submit Job**: Company earnings query
3. **Repeater**: Poll job status every 60 seconds
4. **Check Status**: Until completed
5. **Pull Job Data**: Get structured results
6. **Transform**: Map to CRM fields
7. **CRM Module**: Create or update records

### Webhook-triggered research

Start research jobs from external applications:

1. **Webhook Trigger**: Receive company name
2. **Submit Job**: Build query with webhook data
3. **Repeater**: Poll for completion
4. **Pull Job Data**: Get results
5. **HTTP Module**: Send results back to webhook caller

### Monitor with notifications

Set up recurring research with email alerts:

1. **Create Monitor**: Configure with schedule
2. **Wait**: Until first execution completes
3. **Pull Monitor Output**: Get aggregated results
4. **Filter**: For new records only
5. **Email Module**: Send summary

## Pagination

When retrieving large result sets, use pagination in the Pull Job Data module:

```
Page 1: Records 1-100
Page 2: Records 101-200
Page 3: Records 201-300
```

Set the **Page** and **Page Size** fields to control which records are returned.
The maximum page size is 1000.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection fails

**Symptom**: "Invalid API key" or 403 error

**Solution**: Verify your API key is active in the
[platform dashboard](https://platform.newscatcherapi.com). Delete and recreate
the connection with a valid key.

### Job never completes

**Symptom**: Repeater exhausts all iterations without completion

**Solution**: Increase the Repeater count to 20 iterations or extend the
interval to 90 seconds. Jobs typically complete in 10-15 minutes.

### Module returns no data

**Symptom**: Pull Job Data returns empty array

**Solution**: Verify the job status shows `completed` before pulling results.
Check the `valid_records` count in the status response.

### Monitor creation fails

**Symptom**: Error creating monitor

**Solution**: Ensure the reference job has completed successfully before
creating a monitor. The `job_id` must reference a completed job.
