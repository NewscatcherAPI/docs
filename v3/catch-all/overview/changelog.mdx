<Update label="0.6.1" description="2026-01-13">
## Job continuation and early result access

**Features:**

- **Job continuation**: Submit jobs with the optional `limit` parameter for fast
  testing. Review results and continue jobs with `/catchAll/continue` to process
  more records without restarting.
- **Early result access**: Pull results during the `enriching` stage without
  waiting for job completion. A new `progress_validated` field shows validation
  progress as results become available in batches.
- **Monitor updates**: Update webhook configuration for existing monitors
  without recreating them.

**Endpoints:**

- [`POST /catchAll/continue`](/v3/catch-all/endpoints/continue-job) — Continue
  completed job with higher limit.
- [`PATCH /catchAll/monitors/{monitor_id}`](/v3/catch-all/endpoints/update-monitor)
  — Update monitor webhook configuration.

**Improvements:**

- Expanded search range provides broader coverage for improved recall.

</Update>

## API response enhancements and monitor configuration

**Features:**

- **Enrichments metadata**: Job pull endpoint returns `enrichments` array
  listing all extracted field names.
- **Human-readable schedules**: Monitor list includes `schedule_human_readable`
  alongside cron expressions.
- **Webhook visibility**: Monitor list exposes full webhook configuration
  including URL, method, and headers.

**Improvements:**

- Pull endpoints return all citations without limits.
- Monitors require minimum 24-hour intervals between executions.
- First webhook execution includes complete reference job results.
- Improved validation error messages for invalid schedules.

</Update>

<Update label="0.4.10" description="2025-11-18">
## Status tracking and monitor improvements

Enhanced status tracking with processing steps and improved monitor
functionality for time-constrained queries.

**Features:**

- **Progress tracking**: Status endpoint now returns detailed
  [`steps`](/v3/catch-all/endpoints/get-job-status#response-steps) array showing
  completion state for each processing stage.
- **Monitor timestamps**: Monitor records include `added_on` and `updated_on`
  fields to track when each data record was first collected and last updated
  across job executions.
- **Time-constrained jobs**: Monitors now work with reference jobs that include
  time constraints. The system automatically adapts date-specific validators for
  each execution.

**Improvements:**

- [`GET /catchAll/jobs/user`](/v3/catch-all/endpoints/list-user-jobs) now
  returns only user-created jobs, excluding repeated monitor jobs.
- Monitor responses use
  [`run_info`](/v3/catch-all/endpoints/get-monitor-results#response-run-info)
  structure with `first_run` and `last_run` timestamps instead of `date_range`
  for clearer execution metadata.
- Improved error handling in monitor creation endpoint with specific validation
  messages for invalid schedules and incomplete reference jobs.

</Update>

<Update label="0.4.5" description="2025-11-08">
## Monitor webhooks and deduplication

Introduced webhook notifications and intelligent deduplication for monitors to
streamline automated data collection workflows.

**Features:**

- **Webhook notifications**: Receive real-time POST notifications when scheduled
  monitor jobs complete, including monitor ID, latest job ID, and record counts.
- **Intelligent deduplication**: Monitors automatically eliminate duplicate
  records across job executions, sending only new results to webhooks.
- **Monitor management**: Enable or disable monitors to control automated job
  execution.

**Endpoints:**

- [`GET /catchAll/monitors`](/v3/catch-all/endpoints/list-monitors) — List all
  monitors for your API key.
- [`POST /catchAll/monitors/{monitor_id}/enable`](/v3/catch-all/endpoints/enable-monitor)
  — Enable a disabled monitor.
- [`POST /catchAll/monitors/{monitor_id}/disable`](/v3/catch-all/endpoints/disable-monitor)
  — Disable an active monitor.

**Improvements:**

- Reduced default date range from 14 days to 5 days for faster job processing.
- Limited maximum date range to 30 days to maintain optimal performance.
- Fixed special characters displaying incorrectly in article text.
- Improved error handling when monitor jobs have incomplete data.

</Update>

<Update label="0.3.8" description="2025-11-02">
## Pagination and reliability improvements

Enhanced core functionality with pagination fixes, job tracking capabilities,
and improved data quality.

**Endpoints:**

- [`GET /catchAll/jobs/user`](/v3/catch-all/endpoints/list-user-jobs) — List all
  jobs created with your API key.
- [`GET /catchAll/monitors/pull/{monitor_id}`](/v3/catch-all/endpoints/get-monitor-results)
  — Retrieve aggregated results from all monitor jobs.

**Improvements:**

- Fixed pagination returning all records instead of the requested page.
- Enhanced pagination support for handling large result sets with `page` and
  `page_size` parameters.
- Fixed jobs failing to complete during data extraction.
- Fixed special characters displaying incorrectly in article text.
- Fixed timezone errors when scheduling monitor jobs.
- Fixed monitors failing to execute all configured queries.

</Update>

## Monitors feature

Introduced [monitors for automated queries](/v3/catch-all/overview/monitors) —
schedule recurring data collection with natural language and webhook
notifications.

**Features:**

- **Schedule automation**: Create monitors that run queries on schedules defined
  in natural language (e.g., "every day at 12 PM UTC").
- **Job tracking**: Track all jobs associated with a monitor.
- **Execution history**: Retrieve job execution history and status for each
  monitor.
- **Webhook notifications**: Get notified when scheduled jobs complete.

**Endpoints:**

- [`POST /catchAll/monitors/create`](/v3/catch-all/endpoints/create-monitor) —
  Create scheduled monitor.
- [`GET /catchAll/monitors/{monitor_id}/jobs`](/v3/catch-all/endpoints/list-monitor-jobs)
  — List monitor jobs.

**Improvements:**

- Added date range information to results showing the time period covered.
- Fixed incorrect date filtering in search results.

  structured data with source citations.
- **[Dynamic schemas](/v3/catch-all/overview/dynamic-schemas)**: Response
  structures adapt to your query, generating relevant fields automatically.

  validation, and extraction phases.
- **Real-time status tracking**: Monitor job progress from submission to
  completion.

**Endpoints:**

- [`POST /catchAll/submit`](/v3/catch-all/endpoints/create-job) — Create jobs
  with natural language queries.
- [`GET /catchAll/status/{job_id}`](/v3/catch-all/endpoints/get-job-status) —
