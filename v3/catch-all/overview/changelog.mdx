Introduced [monitors for automated queries](/v3/catch-all/overview/monitors) —
schedule recurring data collection with natural language and webhook
notifications.

  in natural language (e.g., "every day at 12 PM UTC").
- **Job tracking**: Track all jobs associated with a monitor.
- **Execution history**: Retrieve job execution history and status for each
  monitor.
- **Webhook notifications**: Get notified when scheduled jobs complete.

**New endpoints:**

- [`POST /catchAll/monitors/create`](/v3/catch-all/endpoints/create-monitor) —
  Create scheduled monitor.
- [`GET /catchAll/monitors/{monitor_id}/jobs`](/v3/catch-all/endpoints/list-monitor-jobs)
  — List monitor jobs.

**Additional improvements:**

- Job status responses now include complete job details during analysis phase
  for better visibility into processing progress.

## Initial beta release

CatchAll API transforms natural language questions into structured, validated
data extracted from web sources.

**Features:**

- **Natural language processing**: Submit queries in plain English and receive
  structured data with source citations.
- **[Dynamic schemas](/v3/catch-all/overview/understanding-dynamic-schemas)**:
  Response structures adapt to your query, generating relevant fields
  automatically.
- **12-stage pipeline**: Track your job through analysis, retrieval, clustering,
  validation, and extraction phases.
- **Real-time status tracking**: Monitor job progress from submission to
  completion.

**Available endpoints:**

- [`POST /catchAll/submit`](/v3/catch-all/endpoints/create-job) — Create jobs
  with natural language queries.
- [`GET /catchAll/status/{job_id}`](/v3/catch-all/endpoints/get-job-status) —
  Check processing status.
- [`GET /catchAll/pull/{job_id}`](/v3/catch-all/endpoints/get-job-results) —
