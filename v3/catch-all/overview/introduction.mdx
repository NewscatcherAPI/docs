sidebarTitle: Introduction
description: Find all results, not just top candidates
---

CatchAll is a web search API that generates unique datasets that don't exist 
anywhere else on the web. Built on NewsCatcher's proprietary real-world event 
index, it delivers state-of-the-art recall—finding all relevant events, not just 
top results.

## How it works

CatchAll processes queries through a multi-stage pipeline that analyzes over 
50,000 web pages per job:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Analyze">
    Generates targeted search queries for NewsCatcher's proprietary news index 
    and creates validation rules and extraction patterns based on your input.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fetch">
    Retrieves and processes 50,000+ articles from web sources to ensure 
    comprehensive coverage.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Cluster">
    Groups related articles into distinct real-world events using the Leiden 
    algorithm for community detection.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Validate">
    Applies generated validators to filter clusters, ensuring only relevant 
    events that match your criteria proceed to extraction.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Extract">
    Transforms validated events into structured JSON records with dynamic 
    schemas tailored to your query.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Processing typically takes 10-15 minutes per job. Poll the status endpoint
  every 30-60 seconds to track progress through each stage.
</Note>

<Tip>
  Each job returns structured JSON records with dynamic schemas. Fields like 
  `company_name`, `deal_value`, and `acquisition_date` are automatically 
  generated based on your query.
  
  See the [Quickstart > Review response](/v3/catch-all/overview/quickstart#steps) 
  for a complete response example.
</Tip>

## Key characteristics

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Dynamic schemas" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
    Each job generates a unique response schema. Field names and structure in the `enrichment` object vary between jobs—even with identical inputs.

    **Guaranteed fields in every record:**
    - `record_id`
    - `record_title`
    - `citations` array

    **Variable fields:**
    - All other fields in `enrichment` (names, types, structure)
    - Number of records returned
    - Specific content extracted

    <Tip>
      See [Understanding dynamic schemas](/v3/catch-all/overview/dynamic-schemas) for integration patterns.
    </Tip>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Non-deterministic processing" icon="shuffle">

    Identical queries can produce different results:
    - LLMs may generate different keywords, validators, and extractors.
    - Different content sources may be retrieved.
    - Field names and structure vary between runs.
    - Record counts differ.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Asynchronous operation" icon="clock">
    Each query creates a job that processes asynchronously. 
    Use the returned `job_id` to poll the job status from [`steps`](/v3/catch-all/endpoints/get-job-status#response-steps-status)
    and retrieve results when the job is completed.
