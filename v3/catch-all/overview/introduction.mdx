sidebarTitle: Introduction
description: Ask questions in plain English. Get structured data with citations.
---

CatchAll converts natural language queries into structured, machine-readable
records extracted from web sources. Instead of manually searching and organizing
information, you submit questions in plain English and receive validated records
with source citations—ready for analysis, automation, or integration into your
applications.

## How it works

CatchAll processes queries through a multi-stage pipeline:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Analyze">
    Generates search queries, validators, and extractors from your input
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fetch">Retrieves relevant content from web sources</Step>
  <Step title="Cluster">Groups similar content into distinct events</Step>
  <Step title="Validate">Filters clusters based on relevance criteria</Step>
  <Step title="Extract">Pulls structured data from validated clusters</Step>
  <Step title="Return">Delivers records with source citations</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Processing typically takes 10-15 minutes per job. Poll the status endpoint
  every 30-60 seconds to track progress.
</Note>

## Key characteristics

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Dynamic schemas" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
    Each job generates a unique response schema. Field names and structure in the `enrichment` object vary between jobs—even with identical inputs.

    **Guaranteed fields in every record:**
    - `record_id`
    - `record_title`
    - `citations` array

    **Variable fields:**
    - All other fields in `enrichment` (names, types, structure)
    - Number of records returned
    - Specific content extracted

    <Tip>
      See [Understanding dynamic schemas](/v3/catch-all/overview/dynamic-schemas) for integration patterns.
    </Tip>

  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="Non-deterministic processing" icon="shuffle">
  Identical queries can produce different results: 
  - LLMs may generate different keywords, validators, and extractors. 
  - Different content sources may be retrieved.
  - Field names and structure vary between runs.
  - Record counts differ.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Asynchronous operation" icon="clock">
    Each query creates a job that processes asynchronously. 
    Use the returned `job_id` to poll for status and retrieve results when the job completes.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
