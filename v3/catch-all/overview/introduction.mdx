CatchAll transforms natural language questions into structured, validated
records extracted from web sources. Instead of searching with keywords and
filters, you ask a question in plain English and receive organized data with
source citations.

## What is CatchAll API?

CatchAll provides an end-to-end pipeline for converting natural language queries
into structured event data. The system analyzes your question, retrieves
relevant content from diverse sources (news sites, government databases, public
records, corporate sites), clusters similar information, validates relevance,
and extracts structured data tailored to your specific query.

## How it works

CatchAll processes your query through a multi-stage pipeline:

1. **Analyze**: Extracts keywords, generates validation rules and data.
   extractors from your natural language query.
2. **Fetch**: Retrieves relevant content from web sources using generated search
   queries (typically 10 queries per job).
3. **Cluster**: Groups similar content into distinct events using embeddings.
4. **Validate**: Applies LLM-based validation to filter relevant clusters.
5. **Extract**: Extracts structured data with dynamically generated field names.
6. **Return**: Provides structured records with source citations.

Processing typically takes 10-15 minutes per job.

## Key characteristics

### Dynamic schemas

LLMs generate response schemas at runtime. The enrichment fields in records vary
based on your inputs (`query`, `context`, `summary_template`). Only `record_id`,
`record_title`, and `citations` are guaranteed in every record. If you specify
`summary_template`, the `enrichment` object also includes the
`template_base_summary` field.

To learn more, see the
[Result response](/v3/catch-all/overview/introduction#results-response) example.

### Non-deterministic results

Identical queries can produce different results because:

- LLMs may generate different keywords, validators, and extractors.
- Different content sources may be retrieved.
- Field names and structure vary between runs.
- The number of records extracted can differ significantly.

This behavior is expected and allows the system to adapt to any query type
without predefined schemas.

### Asynchronous processing

Each query creates a job that processes asynchronously. You receive a `job_id`
to poll for status and retrieve results when complete.

## Base URL

For API requests use the following base URL:

```bash
https://catchall.newscatcherapi.xyz
```

## Endpoints

| Endpoint                    | Method | Description      | Use Case                                             |
| --------------------------- | ------ | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `/catchAll/submit`          | POST   | Create a new job | Submit a natural language query to start processing  |
| `/catchAll/status/{job_id}` | GET    | Check job status | Monitor processing progress through 12 status stages |
| `/catchAll/pull/{job_id}`   | GET    | Get job results  | Retrieve structured records when job completes       |

## Request format

Include your API key in the `x-api-key` header for each request. All requests
must use HTTPS.

## Job statuses

To monitor the progress of your job, use the `/status/{job_id}` endpoint. We
recommend polling this endpoint every 30-60 seconds.

Jobs move through the following statuses:

| Status                           | Description                                   | Typical Duration |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `pending`                        | Job queued, waiting to start                  | Seconds          |
| `analysis_started`               | Beginning query analysis                      | Seconds          |
| `analysis_keywords_extracted`    | Keywords identified from query                | 30-60 seconds    |
| `analysis_enrichments_extracted` | Validators and extractors generated           | 30-60 seconds    |
| `analysis_queries_extracted`     | Search queries created (typically 10 queries) | 30-60 seconds    |
| `retrieval_dispatched`           | Queries sent to fetching service              | Seconds          |
| `data_fetched`                   | Articles retrieved from news database         | 3-5 minutes      |
| `clustering_dispatched`          | Clustering process initiated                  | Seconds          |
| `data_grouped`                   | Similar articles clustered                    | 2-4 minutes      |
| `enrichment_dispatched`          | Validation and extraction started             | Seconds          |
| `data_enriched`                  | Structured data extracted from valid clusters | 4-6 minutes      |
| `job_completed`                  | Job finished, results ready                   | -                |

## Use cases

CatchAll is designed for applications requiring structured data from
unstructured web content:

- **Market intelligence**: Track company earnings, M&A activity, product
  launches.
- **Regulatory monitoring**: Follow policy changes, government actions,
  compliance updates.
- **Business development**: Discover partnerships, funding rounds, market
  entries.
- **Competitive analysis**: Monitor competitor activities and announcements.
- **Research automation**: Extract structured data for academic or business
  research.
- **News aggregation**: Build topic-specific news applications with structured
  output.

## Current limitations (Beta)

These features are planned for implementation after the beta period:

- Formal error handling and `failed` status
- Error response objects with detailed failure information
- Maximum job duration enforcement
- Result expiration and cleanup
- Query deduplication (submitting the same query creates separate jobs)
- Pagination for large result sets
