Well-constructed queries determine the quality of your CatchAll results. This
guide shows you how to write queries that return focused and relevant results.

## Quick checklist

Before submitting a query, verify it:

- [Target events that appear in news](#target-events-in-news)
- [Define clear event type](#define-clear-event-type)
- [Include 2-4 constraints](#balance-specificity) (not 8+)
- [Focus on recent events](#focus-on-recent-events) (within 30 days)
- [Use single entity or entity category](#use-single-entity)

<Tip>
  Start here if you're unsure about your query. Each point is explained in
  detail below.
</Tip>

## Target events in news

CatchAll searches for events in news articles, not in general knowledge
databases. Your queries should describe events that appear in the news.

<CodeGroup>

```text ✅ Good queries
AI company acquisitions announced this month
FDA drug approvals for cancer treatments
Venture capital funding rounds for fintech startups
```

```text ❌ Poor queries
Product features of iPhone 15
(This is product information, not a news event)

Historical GDP data by country
(This is a data lookup, not reportable events)

How does photosynthesis work
(This is educational content, not news)
```

</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
  Ask yourself: "Would a journalist write a news article about this?" If not,
  rephrase as a specific event.
</Tip>

## Define clear event type

Target specific, recognizable event types with clear structure:

| Event Category | Examples                                                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Business       | Acquisitions, mergers, IPOs, funding rounds, bankruptcies     |
| Corporate      | Layoffs, executive appointments, restructuring, earnings      |
| Regulatory     | FDA approvals, product recalls, legal rulings, policy changes |
| Technology     | Product launches, patent filings, security breaches           |
| Market         | Stock listings, delisting, major price movements              |

<CodeGroup>

```text ✅ Good queries
FDA drug approvals for rare diseases
(Specific agency + event type + category)

Tech company IPOs valued over $1B
(Industry + event type + threshold)

Executive departures at Fortune 500 companies
(Event type + company category)
```

```text ❌ Poor queries
Tech industry trends
(This is analysis/commentary, not a specific event)

AI developments
(Too vague - what kind of development?)

Tesla news
(Not event-focused - what happened?)
```

</CodeGroup>

## Balance specificity

Too broad generates noise. Too specific creates filters that are too restrictive
and return few results. Include 2-4 constraints such as event type, industry,
threshold, or geography.

<CodeGroup>

```text ✅ Optimal
AI company acquisitions over $50M
(Event type + industry + threshold = focused)

Series B funding rounds for healthcare startups
(Stage + industry = clear target)

FDA drug approvals for oncology treatments
(Agency + event + medical field = specific)
```

```text ❌ Too broad
Company news
(Could match millions of articles about anything)

Technology announcements
(Too vague - what type of announcement?)
```

```text ❌ Too specific
Series C funding rounds for AI cybersecurity companies in San Francisco
over $100M announced on Tuesdays
(7 constraints - too many will match nothing)
```

</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
  Use the `context` parameter for preferences and extraction guidance. This
  keeps your `query` focused on the core event.
</Tip>

## Focus on recent events

CatchAll searches articles published within a configurable date window. The
default is 5 days, with a maximum of 30 days.

<Note>
  **Important:** The date range refers to article publication date, not when the
  event occurred. Historical events work only if recent articles provide
  retrospectives or anniversary coverage.
</Note>

<CodeGroup>

```text ✅ Good queries
Tech IPOs announced this week
Recent cybersecurity incidents at healthcare companies
AI model releases in the past month
```

```text ❌ Poor queries
Apple acquisitions in 2020
(Unless recent articles discuss these, they won't appear)

COVID-19 impact on retail in 2021
(Too far in the past, no recent coverage)

Facebook's Cambridge Analytica scandal
(Historical event without recent news coverage)
```

</CodeGroup>

### Time-based queries for monitors

<Note>
  **Version 0.4.10 update:** Time-based filters are automatically adapted for
  monitor executions.
</Note>

For single jobs, time constraints help focus on specific timeframes:

```text ✅ Good queries
Tech IPOs announced this week
(Focuses on very recent announcements)

AI acquisitions in the last 3 days
(Narrow time window for breaking news)

Yesterday's cybersecurity incidents
(For daily monitoring of security events)
```

For monitors, the system automatically adapts time-based filters for recurring
execution. However, open-ended queries produce more predictable results:

<CodeGroup>

```text ✅ Works (adapted automatically)
Tech IPOs announced this week
(System adjusts "this week" for each run)

Recent data breaches at financial institutions
(System interprets "recent" based on schedule)

Latest AI model releases
(System adapts "latest" for each execution)
```

```text ✅ Preferred (clearer intent)
Tech company IPOs
(Open-ended - finds all IPOs in each time window)

Data breaches at financial institutions
(Clear event type without time reference)

AI model releases from major labs
(Specific enough without relative time terms)
```

</CodeGroup>

See [Configure monitors](/v3/catch-all/how-to/configure-monitors) for
monitor-specific guidance.

## Use single entity

Queries focused on one primary entity (company, location, technology, industry)
produce better results than queries spanning multiple unrelated entities.

**Related entities** share a category or context (all tech companies, all in the
same geography, all in the same sector).

**Unrelated entities** span different categories (mixing companies +
geographies + product types). The system may require ALL unrelated entities to
appear in the same article, which means you'll miss relevant results about
individual entities.

<CodeGroup>

```text ✅ Single entity (recommended)
Microsoft acquisitions in AI sector
(One company, one industry - clear focus)

Venture funding in San Francisco
(One location - all relevant companies)

Cybersecurity breaches at healthcare companies
(One industry - specific event type)
```

```text ✅ Multiple related entities (acceptable)
FAANG company acquisitions
(Related: all tech giants in same category)

Funding rounds in New York, San Francisco, or Boston
(Related: all major US tech hubs)

Data breaches at banks or insurance companies
(Related: all financial services sector)
```

```text ❌ Multiple unrelated entities (avoid)
Apple and Microsoft acquisitions
(May require BOTH companies in same article - misses individual deals)

Layoffs at tech companies in Europe and funding rounds in Asia
(Different event types + different regions = confused search)

Product launches by Samsung, recalls by Ford, acquisitions by Pfizer
(Three companies + three event types = too scattered)
```
