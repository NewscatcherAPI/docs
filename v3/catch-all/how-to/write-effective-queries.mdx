Well-constructed queries determine the quality of your CatchAll results. This
guide shows you how to write queries that return focused, relevant events.

## Quick checklist

Before submitting a query, review these recommendations:

- [Describe real-world events](#describe-real-world-events) (not article
  retrieval)
- [Specify event type](#specify-event-type) (acquisitions, recalls, incidents)
- [Add 2-4 details](#add-2-4-details) (industry, amount, location)
- [Stay within 30 days](#stay-within-30-days) (default 5 days, max 30 days)
- [Keep queries focused](#keep-queries-focused) (single event type recommended)

<Tip>
  Start here if you're unsure about your query. Each point is explained in
  detail below.
</Tip>

### What CatchAll finds

CatchAll, by design, focuses on identifying and extracting **real-world events**
— things that actually happen and get reported. The system queries a
continuously updated index of 2+ billion articles, featuring time-sensitive,
event-driven content.

**CatchAll is for finding events:**

- Acquisitions, funding rounds, product launches
- Regulatory approvals, recalls, legal rulings
- Executive changes, layoffs, facility openings

**CatchAll is not for static content:**

- Product specifications or historical data tables
- Educational content, how-to guides, or reference material
- Evergreen articles or encyclopedic content

**The difference:**

- **Traditional search:** "Information about clinical trials" → Articles
  explaining what clinical trials are
- **CatchAll:** "Phase 3 clinical trial results for oncology drugs" → Every
  specific trial result with efficacy data, statistical significance, and trial
  identifiers

<CodeGroup>
```text ✅ Good queries (describe events)
Find all seed-round funding in the AI space over $5M in January 2026
List all road infrastructure projects announced in the US, California
Data breaches at financial institutions over the last week
```

```text ❌ Poor queries (request articles or static data)
Catch all news from CNBC since December 1
(Requests articles, not events)

Find articles about iPhone 15 features 
(Static product information, not events)

Get historical GDP data by country 
(Data lookup, not events)
```
</CodeGroup>

## Specify event type

An **event** is something that happens and gets reported. CatchAll can only find
events that appear in published content—if something happens but isn't reported
anywhere, it's not observable to the system.

Target recognizable event types that get consistently reported:

| Event Category | Examples |
|---------------|----------|
| Business | Acquisitions, mergers, IPOs, funding rounds, bankruptcies |
| Corporate | Layoffs, executive appointments, restructuring, earnings reports |
| Regulatory | FDA approvals, product recalls, legal rulings, policy changes |
| Technology | Product launches, patent filings, security breaches |
| Incidents | Data breaches, workplace accidents, service outages |
| Financial | Credit downgrades, bond defaults, banking failures |
| Infrastructure | Construction starts, facility openings, plant closures |
| Legal | Lawsuit filings, settlements, consent decrees |

<Note>
  This list is not exhaustive. CatchAll can find any event type that gets reported
  across authoritative web sources. If you can describe "what happened," CatchAll
  can find it.
</Note>

<CodeGroup>
```text ✅ Good queries
FDA drug approvals for rare diseases
(Specific agency + event type + category)

Tech company IPOs valued over $1B
(Industry + event type + threshold)

Executive departures at Fortune 500 companies
(Event type + company category)
```

```text ❌ Poor queries
Tech industry trends
(Analysis/commentary, not specific event)

AI developments
(Too vague—what kind of development?)

Tesla news
("News" requests content, no event type specified)
```
</CodeGroup>

## Add 2-4 details

Balance breadth and focus. Too few details returns everything; too many details
returns nothing. Add 2-4 details like industry, threshold, or geography.

<CodeGroup>
```text ✅ Optimal (2-4 details)
AI company acquisitions over $50M
(Event type + industry + threshold)

Series B funding rounds for healthcare startups
(Stage + industry)

FDA drug approvals for oncology treatments
(Agency + event type + medical field)
```

```text ❌ Too few details
Acquisitions
(No industry, geography, or threshold—millions of potential results)

Technology announcements
(What kind of announcement? Product launch? Partnership? Earnings?)
```

```text ❌ Too many details
Series C funding rounds for AI cybersecurity companies
in San Francisco over $100M announced on Tuesdays
(7 details—very few results will match all constraints)
```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
  Use the `context` parameter for extraction preferences. Keep your `query`
  focused on the core event.
</Tip>

## Stay within 30 days

CatchAll searches for events within a date window. If you don't specify a
timeframe in your query, the system uses a 5-day default. Maximum timeframe is
30 days.

<CodeGroup>
```text ✅ Good queries
Tech IPOs announced this week
Recent cybersecurity incidents at healthcare companies
AI model releases in the past month
```

```text ❌ Poor queries
Apple product recalls in 2019
(Historical events - outside 30-day window)

Corporate bankruptcies in 2025
(Entire year requested - exceeds 30-day maximum)

Supply chain disruptions since January 2024
(Multi-month range exceeds 30-day maximum)
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  For monitors, the system automatically adapts time-based filters for recurring
  execution. See [Configure monitors](/v3/catch-all/how-to/configure-monitors)
  for monitor-specific guidance.
</Note>

## Keep queries focused

Focused queries produce cleaner, more useful results. If your query combines
multiple entities or event types, consider splitting it into separate queries.

<CodeGroup>
```text ✅ Recommended: Single event type
Apple acquisitions in AI sector
(Focused on one company's M&A activity)

Data breaches at healthcare companies 
(Focused on security incidents in one industry)

Series B funding rounds for fintech startups 
(Focused on one funding stage in one sector)
```

```text ⚠️ Works, but consider splitting
Acquisitions by Apple, Microsoft, and Google
(Mixed results - three different companies' strategies)

Better approach:
- Query 1: Apple acquisitions
- Query 2: Microsoft acquisitions
- Query 3: Google acquisitions
```

```text ❌ Difficult to work with
Apple acquisitions and Microsoft layoffs
(Mixes two different event types)

Acquisitions by Apple, layoffs at Meta, or IPOs from AI startups
(Mixes three companies and three event types)

Better approach: Split into focused queries for each event type.
```
