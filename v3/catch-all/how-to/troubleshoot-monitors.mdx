This guide helps you diagnose and resolve common monitor issues.

<Tip>
  For preventive measures and configuration guidance, see [Configure
  monitors](/v3/catch-all/how-to/configure-monitors).
</Tip>

## Monitor returns zero records

**Symptom**: Webhook shows `"records_count": 0` on every execution after the
first.

**Cause**: Time-constrained query created date-specific validators.

**Solution**:

1. Check the reference job's `validators` array for time-based validators.
2. Create a new job with an open-ended query (no time constraints).
3. Create a new monitor from the corrected job.
4. Disable the problematic monitor.

**Example fix**:

❌ **Original query**: `"AI company acquisitions announced this week"`

✅ **Corrected query**: `"AI company acquisitions"`

<Tip>
For more details on avoiding time-constrained queries, see [Configure monitors:
Verify reference job
quality](/v3/catch-all/how-to/configure-monitors#verify-reference-job-quality).
</Tip>

## Webhook not firing

**Symptoms**:

- No POST requests received at your endpoint.
- Monitor shows jobs executing but no notifications.

**Troubleshooting steps**:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check endpoint accessibility">
    Verify your webhook URL is publicly accessible:
    ```bash
    curl -X POST https://your-endpoint.com/webhook \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"test": "data"}'
    ```
    
    Should return 2xx status code.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify HTTPS">
    Ensure your webhook URL uses HTTPS (not HTTP):

    - ✅ `https://your-endpoint.com/webhook` 
    - ❌ `http://your-endpoint.com/webhook`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check firewall rules">
    Ensure your server's firewall allows incoming POST requests on the webhook
    port.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test with webhook.site">
    Create a temporary webhook at [webhook.site](https://webhook.site) and update
    your monitor to verify the issue is with your endpoint.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review server logs">
    Check your server logs for:
    - Incoming requests that failed
    - Authentication errors
    - Timeout errors
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Schedule not running as expected

**Symptom**: Monitor executes at wrong times or wrong intervals.

**Cause**: Invalid schedule format was parsed incorrectly.

**Solution**:

Check the parsed cron expression in your monitor results:

```bash
curl "https://catchall.newscatcherapi.com/catchAll/monitors/pull/{monitor_id}" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" | jq .cron_expression
```

**Common patterns**:

- `0 12 * * *` = Daily at 12:00 PM UTC ✅
- `0 */6 * * *` = Every 6 hours ✅
- `0 * * * *` = Top of every hour ✅
- `* * * * *` = Every minute ❌ **(parsing error)**

If the cron expression is incorrect, create a new monitor with a different
schedule format.

<Tip>
For valid schedule formats, testing procedures, and a complete cron expression
reference, see [Configure monitors: Test schedules before
production](/v3/catch-all/how-to/configure-monitors#test-schedules-before-production).
</Tip>

## Duplicate records appearing

**Symptom**: Same event appears multiple times in aggregated results.

**Expected behavior**: The system automatically deduplicates records across
executions. If you're seeing duplicates, this indicates a potential issue.

**Troubleshooting**:

1. Check if the duplicates have different `record_id` values.
2. Verify that citations differ between duplicate records.
3. If true duplicates exist, contact support with:
   - `monitor_id`
   - `record_id` values of duplicates
   - Example records

## High costs from frequent execution

**Symptom**: Unexpected billing due to high job count.

**Diagnosis**:

Check your monitor's schedule frequency:

```bash
curl "https://catchall.newscatcherapi.com/catchAll/monitors/pull/{monitor_id}" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" | jq .cron_expression
```

If it shows `* * * * *`, your schedule was parsed as every-minute execution.

**Solutions**:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Disable current monitor">
    ```bash
    curl -X POST "https://catchall.newscatcherapi.com/catchAll/monitors/{monitor_id}/disable" \
      -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create new monitor with correct schedule">
    Create a monitor with an appropriate frequency for your use case.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
For recommended schedule frequencies by use case and cost optimization guidance,
see [Configure monitors: Choose appropriate
schedules](/v3/catch-all/how-to/configure-monitors#choose-appropriate-schedules).

## Webhook returns 500 errors

**Symptom**: Webhook endpoint returns 500 Internal Server Error.

**Common causes**:

- Processing takes longer than 5 seconds
- Unhandled exceptions in webhook handler
- Database connection issues

**Solutions**:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Return 200 immediately">
    Acknowledge receipt before processing:
    
    ```python
    @app.route('/webhook', methods=['POST'])
    def webhook():
        payload = request.json
        
        # Return 200 immediately
        process_webhook_async(payload)  # Queue for background processing
        return jsonify({"status": "received"}), 200
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add error handling">
    Always return 200, even on errors:
    
    ```python
    try:
        payload = request.json
        process_webhook_async(payload)
        return jsonify({"status": "received"}), 200
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Webhook error: {e}")
        # Still return 200 to avoid retries
        return jsonify({"status": "error"}), 200
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check server logs">
    Review logs for specific error messages about what's failing.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
For complete webhook implementation with retry logic and logging, see [Configure
monitors: Implement robust
webhooks](/v3/catch-all/how-to/configure-monitors#implement-robust-webhooks).

## Monitor created but not executing

**Symptom**: Monitor created successfully but no jobs appear in execution
history.

**Possible causes**:

- Monitor is disabled
- Schedule hasn't triggered yet
- Invalid schedule format defaulting to never

**Solutions**:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check monitor status">
    ```bash
    curl "https://catchall.newscatcherapi.com/catchAll/monitors" \
      -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
    ```

    Verify `"enabled": true` in the response.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable the monitor if disabled">
    ```bash
    curl -X POST "https://catchall.newscatcherapi.com/catchAll/monitors/{monitor_id}/enable" \
      -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Wait for scheduled execution">
    Allow time for the next scheduled execution based on your schedule interval.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test with short interval">
    Create a test monitor with `"every 5 minutes"` to confirm scheduling works, then create your production monitor.
  </Step>
</Steps>
