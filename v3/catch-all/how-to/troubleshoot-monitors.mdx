This guide helps you diagnose and resolve common monitor issues.

<Tip>
  For configuration guidance and webhook implementation, see [Configure
  monitors](/v3/catch-all/how-to/configure-monitors).
</Tip>

## Monitor returns zero records

**Symptom**: Webhook shows `"records_count": 0` on every execution after the first.

**Possible causes**:

1. Event frequency doesn't match monitor schedule (events occur less frequently than monitor runs).
2. Deduplication is working correctly - same events keep appearing across multiple runs.
3. Reference job had very restrictive validators.

**Troubleshooting steps**:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check reference job validators">
    Review the `validators` array in your reference job results:
```bash
    curl "https://catchall.newscatcherapi.com/catchAll/pull/{reference_job_id}" \
      -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" | jq .validators
```
    
    Overly restrictive validators may limit results.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Assess event frequency vs schedule">
    Consider whether events matching your query occur frequently enough for your monitor schedule:
    
    - ✅ **Good match**: Daily monitor for `"AI startup funding rounds over $10M"` (multiple events per week)
    
    - ❌ **Frequency mismatch**: Daily monitor for `"Unicorn IPOs in biotech sector"` (rare events)
    
    **If events are infrequent:**
    - Adjust monitor schedule (weekly instead of daily)
    - Expand geographic or industry scope
    - Lower thresholds (e.g., `$5M+` instead of `$50M+`)
    </Step>

  <Step title="Check monitor execution history">
    List recent monitor jobs to see the pattern:
    ```bash
        curl "https://catchall.newscatcherapi.com/catchAll/monitors/{monitor_id}/jobs" \
          -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
    ```
    
    If consecutive runs return zero records, adjust event frequency or schedule.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Adjust query or schedule">
    Based on your findings:
    
    **Option 1 - Adjust schedule**: Change from daily to weekly/bi-weekly for rare events.
    
    **Option 2 - Adjust query scope**: Expand to capture more events without losing business value.
    
    Create new reference job → Create new monitor → Disable old monitor.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Monitor deduplication uses a 7-day rolling window. Zero records after the first execution 
often means the same events keep appearing (correct deduplication), not a problem with 
your query.
</Tip>

## Duplicate records appearing

**Symptom**: Same event appears multiple times in aggregated results.

**Expected behavior**: The system automatically deduplicates records across
executions. If you're seeing duplicates, this indicates a potential issue.

**Troubleshooting**:

1. Check if the duplicates have different `record_id` values.
2. Verify that citations differ between duplicate records.
3. If true duplicates exist, contact support with:
   - `monitor_id`
   - `record_id` values of duplicates
   - Example records

## Webhook not firing

**Symptoms**:

- No POST requests received at your endpoint.
- Monitor shows jobs executing but no notifications.

**Troubleshooting steps**:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check endpoint accessibility">
    Verify your webhook URL is publicly accessible:
    ```bash
    curl -X POST https://your-endpoint.com/webhook \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"test": "data"}'
    ```
    
    Should return 2xx status code.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify HTTPS">
    Ensure your webhook URL uses HTTPS (not HTTP):

    - ✅ `https://your-endpoint.com/webhook` 
    - ❌ `http://your-endpoint.com/webhook`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check firewall rules">
    Ensure your server's firewall allows incoming POST requests on the webhook
    port.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test with webhook.site">
    Create a temporary webhook at [webhook.site](https://webhook.site) and update
    your monitor to verify the issue is with your endpoint.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review server logs">
    Check your server logs for:
    - Incoming requests that failed
    - Authentication errors
    - Timeout errors
  </Step>
</Steps>
