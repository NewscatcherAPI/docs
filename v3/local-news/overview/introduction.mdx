## What is Local News API?

Local News API provides location-specific news content across multiple countries
including the United States, Canada, Great Britain, Germany, France, Italy,
China, Thailand, and Switzerland. Building on our core News API v3
infrastructure, it adds dedicated location detection capabilities optimized for
city, county, and regional news coverage. The system processes content from
thousands of local news sources, including small city publishers, regional
outlets, university newspapers, and local government news portals.

## Features

## Key differences from News API v3

For users familiar with our core News API v3, Local News API offers these key
enhancements:

| Feature           | Local News API                                                               | News API v3                               |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Geographic focus  | Local coverage across multiple countries with specialized location detection | Global news coverage                      |
| Location handling | Simple location names plus structured GeoNames filtering                     | Basic geographic filtering                |
| Historical data   | 30 days of history                                                           | Up to 5 years of history                  |
| Source types      | Local newspapers, government sites, university outlets                       | Major publications, international sources |

## Location detection methods

The system uses six distinct methods to detect and validate locations in news
articles:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Dedicated Source" icon="building-columns">
    Identifies articles from news sources exclusively covering a specific
    location (highest confidence)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Local Section" icon="newspaper">
    Identifies locations through dedicated sections in larger publications
  </Card>
  <Card title="Regional Source" icon="map">
    Uses regional context to properly interpret and disambiguate location
    mentions
  </Card>
  <Card title="Standard Format" icon="font">
    Identifies locations written in standard formats like "City, State"
  </Card>
  <Card title="Proximity Mention" icon="arrow-right-arrow-left">
    Detects cities and states mentioned within 15 words of each other
  </Card>
  <Card title="AI Extraction" icon="brain">
    Uses AI-based content analysis to identify locations (requires AI Extraction
    plan)
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

For detailed information on each method, see
[Location detection methods](/v3/local-news/overview/location-detection-methods).

## Request format

Include your API key in the `x-api-token` header for each request. All requests
must use HTTPS.

### Standard endpoint example

<CodeGroup>

```json JSON
{
  "q": "venture capital",
  "locations": ["San Francisco, California"],
  "detection_methods": ["dedicated_source", "standard_format"],
  "lang": "en",
  "from_": "7 days ago",
  "include_translation_fields": true
}
```

```python Python
import requests
import json

API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
URL = "https://local-news.newscatcherapi.com/api/search"
HEADERS = {
    "x-api-token": API_KEY,
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

PAYLOAD = {
    "q": "venture capital",
    "locations": ["San Francisco, California"],
    "detection_methods": ["dedicated_source", "local_section"],
    "lang": "en",
    "from_": "7 days ago",
    "include_translation_fields": True
}

try:
    response = requests.post(URL, headers=HEADERS, json=PAYLOAD)
    response.raise_for_status()
    print(json.dumps(response.json(), indent=2))
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    print(f"Failed to fetch articles: {e}")
```

```bash cURL
curl -X POST \
  'https://local-news.newscatcherapi.com/api/search' \
  -H 'x-api-token: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "q": "venture capital",
    "locations": ["San Francisco, California"],
    "detection_methods": ["dedicated_source", "local_section"],
    "lang": "en",
    "from_": "7 days ago",
    "include_translation_fields": true
  }'
```

</CodeGroup>

### Advanced endpoint example

<CodeGroup>

```json JSON
{
  "q": "venture capital",
  "geonames": [
    {
      "name": "San Francisco",
      "country": "US",
      "admin1": {
        "name": "California"
      },
      "localization_score": {
        "min": 7
      }
    }
  ],
  "lang": "en",
  "from_": "7 days ago",
  "include_translation_fields": true
}
```

```python Python
import requests
import json

API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
URL = "https://local-news.newscatcherapi.com/api/search/advanced"
HEADERS = {
    "x-api-token": API_KEY,
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

PAYLOAD = {
    "q": "venture capital",
    "geonames": [{
        "name": "San Francisco",
        "country": "US",
        "admin1": {
            "name": "California"
        },
        "localization_score": {
            "min": 7
        }
    }],
    "lang": "en",
    "from_": "7 days ago",
    "include_translation_fields": True
}

try:
    response = requests.post(URL, headers=HEADERS, json=PAYLOAD)
    response.raise_for_status()
    print(json.dumps(response.json(), indent=2))
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    print(f"Failed to fetch articles: {e}")
```

```bash cURL
curl -X POST \
  'https://local-news.newscatcherapi.com/api/search/advanced' \
  -H 'x-api-token: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "q": "venture capital",
    "geonames": [{
      "name": "San Francisco",
      "country": "US",
      "admin1": {
        "name": "California"
      },
      "localization_score": {
        "min": 7
      }
    }],
    "lang": "en",
    "from_": "7 days ago",
    "include_translation_fields": true
  }'
```

</CodeGroup>

## Response differences

Both endpoint types include basic article information with metadata, NLP and
translation fields (`title_translated_en`, `content_translated_en`). The main
difference between standard and advanced endpoints is the location data
structure.

### Standard endpoints

Return simple location data:

```json
"locations": [
  {
    "name": "San Francisco, California",
    "detection_methods": ["dedicated_source"]
  }
]
```

### Advanced endpoints

Return structured GeoNames data:

```json
"geonames": [
  {
    "geonames_id": "5391959",
    "name": "San Francisco",
    "country": "US",
    "admin1": {"name": "California", "code": "CA"},
    "coordinates": {"lat": 37.77493, "lon": -122.41942},
    "localization_score": 8.5,
    "confidence_score": 9.2,
    "detection_methods": ["dedicated_source"]
  }
]
```

<Note>
  For detailed information on all available response fields, see [API
  Reference](/v3/local-news/endpoints/search/search-articles-post).
