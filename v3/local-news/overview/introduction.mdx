## What is Local News API?

Local News API is a specialized service focused on U.S. location-specific
content. Building on our core News API v3 infrastructure, it adds dedicated
location detection capabilities optimized for city, county, and state-level news
coverage. The system processes content from thousands of local news sources,
including small city publishers, regional outlets, university newspapers, and
local government news portals.

## Features

## Location detection methods

The system uses six distinct methods to detect and validate locations in news
articles:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Dedicated Source" icon="building-columns">
    Identifies articles from news sources exclusively covering a specific
    location (highest confidence)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Local Section" icon="newspaper">
    Identifies locations through dedicated sections in larger publications
  </Card>
  <Card title="Regional Source" icon="map">
    Uses regional context to properly interpret and disambiguate location
    mentions
  </Card>
  <Card title="Standard Format" icon="font">
    Identifies locations written in standard formats like "City, State"
  </Card>
  <Card title="Proximity Mention" icon="arrow-right-arrow-left">
    Detects cities and states mentioned within 15 words of each other
  </Card>
  <Card title="AI Extraction" icon="brain">
    Uses AI-based content analysis to identify locations (requires AI Extraction
    plan)
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

For detailed information on each method, see
[Location detection methods](/v3/local-news/overview/location-detection-methods).
