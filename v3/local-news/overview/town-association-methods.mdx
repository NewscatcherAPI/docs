  Learn how Local News API connects articles with specific locations using five
  distinct association methods.

## Overview

Town association methods help you accurately connect news articles with specific
locations in your searches. These methods use different matching strategies to
identify location references in articles, from analyzing news sources to
processing natural language patterns.

## Understanding town association

News articles can mention locations in several ways:

- City names ("San Francisco")
- Regional terms ("Bay Area")
- Local landmarks ("Golden Gate Bridge")
- Contextual references ("the city")

The Local News API uses five association methods to capture these different
reference patterns.

## Available methods

### HYPERLOCAL_SOURCES_EXCLUDE_QUERY

Identifies articles from dedicated local news sources that don't mention other
locations.

**Query pattern**:

```
NOT ((Alabama OR Alaska OR Texas...) AND (", AL" OR ", TX"))
```

Use this method when working with:

- City-specific newspapers
- University news portals
- Local government sites
- Regional sections of larger publications

For example:

```json
{
  "name": "San Francisco, California",
  "description": ["HYPERLOCAL_SOURCES_EXCLUDE_QUERY"]
}
```

### HYPERLOCAL_SOURCES_INCLUDE_QUERY

Finds exact matches of city names in article titles or content.

**Query pattern**:

```
"San Francisco"
```

Use this method for:

- Finding explicit city mentions
- Analyzing headlines
- Matching specific location names

### LOCAL_SOURCES_EXCLUDE_QUERY

Searches state-level sources while excluding mentions of other states.

**Query pattern**:

```
city_name NOT (Alabama OR Alaska OR Texas...) AND (",AL" OR ",TX"))
```

Use this method with:

- Regional news outlets
- State-wide publications
- Multi-city coverage sources

### CITY_STATE_COUNTY_QUERY

Searches for standard location format patterns used in journalism.

**Query pattern**:

```
"city, state_code" OR "city, state" OR "city, county"
```

This method matches formats like:

- "San Francisco, CA"
- "San Francisco, California"
- "San Francisco, San Francisco County"

### NEAR_CITY_STATE_QUERY

Finds articles where city and state names appear close to each other.

**Query pattern**:

```
NEAR("San Francisco", "California", 15)
```

This method matches phrases like:

- "New development in San Francisco draws attention across California"
- "California's tech hub San Francisco sees startup growth"

## Implementation guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose your methods">
    Select association methods based on your sources:
    ```python
    PAYLOAD = {
        "associated_towns": [
            {
                "name": "San Francisco, California",
                "description": ["HYPERLOCAL_SOURCES_INCLUDE_QUERY"],
            }
        ]
    }
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Combine methods">
    Use multiple methods for better coverage:
    ```python
    PAYLOAD = {
        "associated_towns": [
            {
                "name": "San Francisco, California",
                "description": [
                    "HYPERLOCAL_SOURCES_EXCLUDE_QUERY",
                    "CITY_STATE_COUNTY_QUERY",
                ],
            }
        ]
    }
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add AI capabilities">
    Enable AI-powered town extraction:
    ```python
    PAYLOAD = {
        "associated_towns": [
            {
                "name": "San Francisco, California",
                "description": ["HYPERLOCAL_SOURCES_EXCLUDE_QUERY"],
            }
        ],
        "search_in_ai_associated_town": True,
    }
    ```
    <Note>
      This feature requires the `v3_local_news_ai_extraction_nlp` plan.
