  This guide will help you make your first API call to Local News API and start
  retrieving location-specific news in just a few minutes.
---

## Before you start

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- An API key for Local News API (obtained from your account manager)
- Python 3.6+ installed on your system
- The `requests` library for Python

## Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set up your environment">

    First, make sure you have Python and the `requests` library installed. You can
    install `requests` using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install requests
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Create your first script">

    Create a new file named `local_news_quickstart.py` and add the following code:

    ```python
    import requests
    import json

    # Configuration
    API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"  # Replace with your actual API key
    URL = "https://local-news.newscatcherapi.com/api/search"
    HEADERS = {"x-api-token": API_KEY, "Content-Type": "application/json"}
    PAYLOAD = {
        "q": "*",
        "associated_towns": [{"name": "San Francisco, California"}],
        "theme": "Tech",
        "lang": "en",
        "from_": "7 days ago",
    }

    try:
        # Fetch articles using POST method
        response = requests.post(URL, headers=HEADERS, json=PAYLOAD)
        response.raise_for_status()  # Check if the request was successful

        # Print the raw JSON response
        print(json.dumps(response.json(), indent=2))

    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"Failed to fetch articles: {e}")
    ```

    Remember to replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual API key.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Run the script and review the results">

    Run the script from your terminal:

    ```bash
    python local_news_quickstart.py
    ```

    You can see a JSON response similar to this (shortened for readability):

    ```json
    {
    "status": "ok",
    "total_hits": 51,
    "page": 1,
    "total_pages": 1,
    "page_size": 100,
    "articles": [
        {
        "id": "d156bb26af2b39ed33bd96b8428b4b21",
        "associated_town": [
            {
            "ai_validated": true,
            "name": "San Francisco, California",
            "description": ["HYPERLOCAL_SOURCES_INCLUDE_QUERY"]
            }
        ],
        "title": "Researchers say an AI-powered transcription tool used in hospitals invents things no one ever said",
        "link": "https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/researchers-say-an-ai-powered-transcription-tool-19864411.php",
        "published_date": "2024-10-26 04:15:41",
        "domain_url": "sfchronicle.com",
        "nlp": {
            "theme": ["Tech", "Science"],
            "summary": "Whisper, an AI-powered transcription tool, is prone to making up chunks of text or entire sentences. It's being used in industries worldwide to translate and transcribe interviews, generate text in popular consumer technologies and create subtitles for videos.",
            "sentiment": {
              "title": 0.8877,
              "content": -0.9958
            },
            // other NLP fields
          }
        }
        // ... additional articles
    ],
    "user_input": {
        "q": "*",
        "associated_towns": [
          {
            "name": "San Francisco, California"
          }
        ],
        "theme": "Tech",
        "lang": "en",
        "from_": "7 days ago"
      }
    }
    ```

    This response shows location-specific articles with rich metadata, including
    town associations, NLP analysis, and article details.

    <Note>
    To learn more about town association, see the [Town association
    methods](/v3/local-news/overview/town-association-methods).
    </Note>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Modify the query to track industry trends">

    Let's modify our script to monitor significant tech industry movements and
    investments across major Bay Area tech hubs:

    ```python
    import requests

    # Configuration
    API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"  # Replace with your actual API key
    URL = "https://local-news.newscatcherapi.com/api/search"
    HEADERS = {"x-api-token": API_KEY, "Content-Type": "application/json"}
    PAYLOAD = {
        "q": "expansion OR investment OR startup OR headquarters",
        "associated_towns": [
            {"name": "San Francisco, California"},
            {"name": "San Jose, California"},
            {"name": "Palo Alto, California"},
        ],
        "theme": "Tech",
        "lang": "en",
        "from_": "7 days ago",
        "clustering": True,
    }

    # Association method descriptions
    ASSOCIATION_METHODS = {
        "HYPERLOCAL_SOURCES_EXCLUDE_QUERY": "Hyper-local source",
        "HYPERLOCAL_SOURCES_INCLUDE_QUERY": "Exact city match",
        "LOCAL_SOURCES_EXCLUDE_QUERY": "State-level source",
        "CITY_STATE_COUNTY_QUERY": "Matches 'City, State' format",
        "NEAR_CITY_STATE_QUERY": "Proximity match",
    }

    try:
        # Fetch articles using POST method
        response = requests.post(URL, headers=HEADERS, json=PAYLOAD)
        response.raise_for_status()

        # Parse and display the articles
        data = response.json()
        clusters = data.get("clusters", {})

        print(f"Found {data['clusters_count']} major tech stories")
        print(f"Total articles: {data['total_hits']}")
        print("---")

        for cluster_id, cluster in clusters.items():
            # Get the main article from each cluster
            article = cluster["articles"][0]

            # Extract key information
            title = article["title"]

            # Process all associated locations
            locations = []
            for town in article["associated_town"]:
                # Get human-readable association methods
                methods = [
                    ASSOCIATION_METHODS.get(method, method)
                    for method in town["description"]
                ]
                # Create location string with validation and methods
                validation = "AI validated" if town.get("ai_validated") else "Not validated"
                loc_str = f"{town['name']} ({validation}, {', '.join(methods)})"
                locations.append(loc_str)

            summary = article["nlp"]["summary"]
            cluster_size = cluster["cluster_size"]
            sentiment = (
                "Positive" if article["nlp"]["sentiment"]["content"] > 0 else "Negative"
            )

            # Print story details
            print(f"TRENDING STORY ({cluster_size} related articles):")
            print(f"Title: {title}")
            print("Locations:")
            for loc in locations:
                print(f"  - {loc}")
            print(f"Sentiment: {sentiment}")
            print(f"Summary: {summary}")
            print("---")

    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"Failed to fetch articles: {e}")
    ```

    Sample output:

    ```bash
    Found 20 major tech stories
    Total articles: 28
    ---
    TRENDING STORY (3 related articles):
    Title: Persona Positioned Highest for Ability to Execute in the
    Inaugural Gartner Magic Quadrantâ„¢ for Identity Verification
    Locations:
    - San Francisco, California (AI validated, Exact city match)
    Sentiment: Positive
    Summary: Persona ranked first across all Use Cases: Know Your Customer (KYC),
    Fraud Detection, Account Recovery, and Sensitive or Regulated scenarios
    in the Gartner Critical Capabilities report. Persona's advanced identity
    verification platform stands as a critical defense that provides granular
    fraud and risk controls to help organizations stay ahead of digital fraud
    and safeguard both their business and customers.

    ```

    The script shows how to:

    - Track major business moves across key tech hubs.
    - Monitor investment activity and expansions.
    - Identify trending stories using clustering.
    - Analyze market sentiment.
    - Get detailed summaries of major developments.

    Each clustered story provides a comprehensive view of significant tech industry
    movements, helping you stay informed about important developments in the Bay
    Area tech scene.
