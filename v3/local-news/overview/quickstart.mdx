description: Get started with location-specific news data using Local News API.
---

Transform your data needs with precise location-specific news content! This
guide helps you make your first API call to access local news articles with
powerful location detection and filtering capabilities.

## Before you start

Before you begin, make sure you meet these prerequisites:

- An API key (obtain one through our
  [pricing page](https://www.newscatcherapi.com/pricing))
- Basic understanding of REST APIs
- Your preferred programming language and HTTP client
- Basic knowledge of JSON data format

## Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set up your environment">

    Make sure you have the necessary HTTP client library installed for your programming language:

    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash curl
    # cURL is typically included in your system
    # To check, open the terminal and type the following:
    curl --version
    ```

    ```bash Python
    pip install requests
    ```

    ```bash TypeScript
    npm install axios
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Create your first script">

    Run the curl command in your terminal, use JSON for the request body in Postman,
    or create a script to fetch local news articles:

    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash curl
    curl -X POST https://local-news.newscatcherapi.com/api/search \
      -H "x-api-token: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "q": "*",
        "locations": ["San Francisco, California"],
        "detection_methods": ["local_section", "ai_extracted"],
        "theme": "Tech",
        "lang": "en",
        "from_": "7 days ago"
      }'
    ```
    ```json JSON
    {
      "q": "*",
      "locations": ["San Francisco, California"],
      "detection_methods": ["local_section", "ai_extracted"],
      "theme": "Tech",
      "lang": "en",
      "from_": "7 days ago"
    }
    ```
    ```python Python
    import requests
    import json

    # Configuration
    API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"  # Replace with your actual API key
    URL = "https://local-news.newscatcherapi.com/api/search"
    HEADERS = {"x-api-token": API_KEY, "Content-Type": "application/json"}

    # Define the search parameters
    PAYLOAD = {
        "q": "*",  # Search for all articles
        "locations": ["San Francisco, California"],  # City to search for
        "detection_methods": [
            "local_section",
            "ai_extracted",
        ],  # How to detect location mentions
        "theme": "Tech",  # Filter for tech news
        "lang": "en",  # English language articles
        "from_": "7 days ago",  # Articles from the last week
    }

    try:
        # Fetch articles using POST method
        response = requests.post(URL, headers=HEADERS, json=PAYLOAD)
        response.raise_for_status()  # Check if the request was successful

        # Print the raw JSON response
        print(json.dumps(response.json(), indent=2))

    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"Failed to fetch articles: {e}")
    ```
    ```typescript TypeScript
    async function fetchLocalNews() {
      const API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"; // Replace with your actual API key
      const URL = "https://local-news.newscatcherapi.com/api/search";

      // Define the search parameters
      const payload = {
        q: "*", // Search for all articles
        locations: ["San Francisco, California"], // City to search for
        detection_methods: ["local_section", "ai_extracted"], // How to detect location mentions
        theme: "Tech", // Filter for tech news
        lang: "en", // English language articles
        from_: "7 days ago" // Articles from the last week
      };

      try {
        // Fetch articles using POST method
        const response = await fetch(URL, {
          method: 'POST',
          headers: {
            'x-api-token': API_KEY,
            'Content-Type': 'application/json'
          },
          body: JSON.stringify(payload)
        });

        if (!response.ok) {
          throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
        }

        // Parse and log the response
        const data = await response.json();
        console.log(JSON.stringify(data, null, 2));
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Failed to fetch articles:', error);
      }
    }

    // Execute the function
    fetchLocalNews();
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

    <Note>
      Remember to replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual API key.
    </Note>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Review the results">

    When you run the script, you receive a JSON response like this (shortened for readability):

    ```json JSON {10-15}
    {
      "status": "ok",
      "total_hits": 51,
      "page": 1,
      "total_pages": 1,
      "page_size": 100,
      "articles": [
        {
          "id": "d156bb26af2b39ed33bd96b8428b4b21",
          "locations": [
            {
              "name": "San Francisco, California",
              "detection_methods": ["local_section"]
            }
          ],
          "title": "Researchers say an AI-powered transcription tool used in hospitals invents things no one ever said",
          "link": "https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/researchers-say-an-ai-powered-transcription-tool-19864411.php",
          "published_date": "2024-10-26 04:15:41",
          "domain_url": "sfchronicle.com",
          // ... other fields
          "nlp": {
            "theme": ["Tech", "Science"],
            "summary": "Whisper, an AI-powered transcription tool, is prone to making up chunks of text or entire sentences. It's being used in industries worldwide to translate and transcribe interviews, generate text in popular consumer technologies and create subtitles for videos.",
            "sentiment": {
              "title": 0.8877,
              "content": -0.9958
            },
            // ... nlp other fields
          }
        }
      ],
    }
    ```

    The response shows location-specific articles with rich metadata, including location detection methods,
    NLP analysis, and article details.
