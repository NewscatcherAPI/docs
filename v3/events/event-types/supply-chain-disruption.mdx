  Monitor and analyze supply chain disruptions using search parameters and field
  criteria.

Events API provides access to structured information about supply chain
disruptions extracted from news articles. This guide explains how to discover
available search fields, construct search requests, and understand the returned
data.

## Available search fields

Get available search fields for supply chain disruption events using the
discovery endpoint:

```bash
GET /api/events_info/get_event_fields?event_type=supply_chain_disruption
```

The endpoint returns the following fields that can be used for filtering search
results. All fields are optional for search requests.

### Common fields

- `company_name`: The name of the primary company affected by the supply chain
  disruption.
- `event_date`: The date when the disruption occurred or was first reported.
- `extraction_date`: The date when the event was extracted from news sources.

### Supply chain disruption-specific fields

- `supply_chain_disruption.disruption_type`: The category of the supply chain
  disruption.
- `supply_chain_disruption.disruption_cause`: A specific description of what
  caused the supply chain disruption.
- `supply_chain_disruption.facility_type`: The category of facility primarily
  affected by the disruption.
- `supply_chain_disruption.facility_original`: The exact phrase or term used in
  the article to describe the affected facility.
- `supply_chain_disruption.additional_affected_companies`: Names of other
  companies affected by the same disruption.
- `supply_chain_disruption.affected_industries`: Industries affected by the
  disruption, using GICS sectors.
- `supply_chain_disruption.affected_products`: The specific products or
  materials affected by the supply chain disruption.
- `supply_chain_disruption.hs_product_categories`: Harmonized System (HS)
  sections of products affected by the disruption.
- `supply_chain_disruption.location`: The locations where the disruption
  occurred.
- `supply_chain_disruption.expected_timeframe`: The general expected timeframe
  for the disruption.
- `supply_chain_disruption.supply_impact_severity`: The severity of impact on
  supply availability.
- `supply_chain_disruption.summary`: A comprehensive summary of the supply chain
  disruption event.

## Searching for events

Use the search endpoint to find supply chain disruption events:

```bash
POST /api/events_search
```

### Basic request structure

```json
{
  "event_type": "supply_chain_disruption",
  "attach_articles_data": true,
  "additional_filters": {
    // search criteria using available fields
  }
}
```

### Using search fields

Search by dates (absolute or relative):

```json
{
  "event_type": "supply_chain_disruption",
  "additional_filters": {
    "event_date": {
      "gte": "2025-03-01",
      "lte": "2025-05-01"
    },
    "extraction_date": {
      "gte": "now-7d",
      "lte": "now"
    }
  }
}
```

Search by disruption type:

```json
{
  "event_type": "supply_chain_disruption",
  "additional_filters": {
    "supply_chain_disruption.disruption_type": "production_stoppage",
    "supply_chain_disruption.facility_type": "manufacturing_plant"
  }
}
```

Search by industry and product categories:

```json
{
  "event_type": "supply_chain_disruption",
  "additional_filters": {
    "supply_chain_disruption.affected_industries": "Materials",
    "supply_chain_disruption.affected_products": "rare earths"
  }
}
```

Search by location:

```json
{
  "event_type": "supply_chain_disruption",
  "additional_filters": {
    "supply_chain_disruption.location.country": "United States",
    "supply_chain_disruption.location.state": "California"
  }
}
```

Search by impact severity:

```json
{
  "event_type": "supply_chain_disruption",
  "additional_filters": {
    "supply_chain_disruption.supply_impact_severity": "severe",
    "supply_chain_disruption.expected_timeframe": "months"
  }
}
```

## Understanding the response

The API returns matched events in this structure:

```json
{
  "message": "Success",
  "count": 7,
  "events": [
    {
      "id": "WlrNi5YBvyT_ytpRIfP4",
      "event_type": "supply_chain_disruption",
      "global_event_type": "SupplyChainOperations",
      "associated_article_ids": ["3b9c292bd7967fe9ed2d2d59427acc44"],
      "extraction_date": "2025-05-01 12:23:18",
      "event_date": "2025-04-28 00:00:00",
      "company_name": "KTM",
      "supply_chain_disruption": {
        "summary": "KTM has halted production at its Mattighofen plant in Austria due to a shortage of components, stemming from financial instability and a lack of supplier confidence. The production stoppage, which began in April 2025, is expected to last until the end of July 2025...",
        "affected_products": ["motorcycles"],
        "supply_impact_severity": "severe",
        "affected_industries": ["Consumer Discretionary"],
        "disruption_type": "production_stoppage",
        "disruption_cause": "Shortage of components due to financial instability and lack of supplier confidence",
        "facility_original": "Mattighofen plant",
        "location": [
          {
            "country": "Austria",
            "city": "Mattighofen",
            "raw_location": "Mattighofen plant",
            "county": "Braunau am Inn",
            "state": "Upper Austria"
          }
        ],
        "facility_type": "manufacturing_plant",
        "hs_product_categories": ["XVII: Vehicles, aircraft, vessels"],
        "expected_timeframe": "months"
      },
      "articles": [
        {
          "link": "https://example.com/article-about-ktm-disruption",
          "id": "3b9c292bd7967fe9ed2d2d59427acc44",
          "media": "https://example.com/image.jpg",
          "title": "KTM Halts Production Due to Component Shortage"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Best practices

1. Use `extraction_date` for monitoring recent supply chain disruptions.
2. Use `event_date` for historical analysis of disruption patterns.
3. Combine `disruption_type` and `facility_type` filters for specific disruption
   scenarios.
4. Use multiple filters to narrow results more precisely.
5. Filter by `supply_impact_severity` to focus on critical disruptions first.
6. For location-based filtering, include as much geographic specificity as
   needed.
