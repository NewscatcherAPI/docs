Events API provides access to structured information about workforce reductions
extracted from news articles. This guide explains how to discover available
search fields, construct search requests, and understand the returned data.

## Available search fields

Get available search fields for layoff events using the discovery endpoint:

```bash
GET /api/events_info/get_event_fields?event_type=layoff
```

The endpoint returns the following fields that can be used for filtering search
results. All fields are optional for search requests.

### Common fields

- `company_name`: The name of the company conducting the layoff.
- `event_date`: The date when the layoff occurred.
- `extraction_date`: The date when the event was extracted from news sources.

### Layoff-specific fields

- `layoff.number_of_people_laid_off`: The exact number of employees affected by
  the layoff.
- `layoff.percentage_of_people_laid_off`: The percentage of total workforce
  affected by the layoff.
- `layoff.min_number_of_people_laid_off`: The minimum number of employees
  affected when a range is specified.
- `layoff.max_number_of_people_laid_off`: The maximum number of employees
  affected when a range is specified.
- `layoff.how_much_related`: The relevance rating of the layoff event. Possible
  values: "Completely Irrelevant", "Irrelevant", "Very Poor", "Poor", "Fair",
  "Good", "Very Good", "Excellent". Default: None.
- `layoff.is_relevant_for_real_estate`: True if the layoff impacts real estate
  markets; false otherwise.
- `layoff.layoff_reason`: The stated reason for the layoff.
- `layoff.location`: The location details of the layoff. Contains fields for
  country, state, city, and county.
- `layoff.summary`: A detailed description of the layoff event, including key
  information about the circumstances and impact.

## Searching for events

Use the search endpoint to find layoff events:

```bash
POST /api/events_search
```

### Basic request structure

```json
{
  "event_type": "layoff",
  "attach_articles_data": true,
  "additional_filters": {
    // search criteria using available fields
  }
}
```

### Using search fields

Search by dates (absolute or relative):

```json
{
  "event_type": "layoff",
  "additional_filters": {
    "event_date": {
      "gte": "2024-01-01",
      "lte": "2024-02-01"
    }
  }
}
```

Search by employee count:

```json
{
  "event_type": "layoff",
  "additional_filters": {
    "layoff.number_of_people_laid_off": {
      "gte": 1000
    },
    "layoff.percentage_of_people_laid_off": {
      "gte": 10
    }
  }
}
```

Search by location:

```json
{
  "event_type": "layoff",
  "additional_filters": {
    "layoff.location.state": "California",
    "layoff.location.city": "San Francisco"
  }
}
```

Search by relevance:

```json
{
  "event_type": "layoff",
  "additional_filters": {
    "layoff.how_much_related": "Excellent",
    "layoff.is_relevant_for_real_estate": "true"
  }
}
```

## Understanding the response

The API returns matched events in this structure:

```json
{
  "message": "Success",
  "count": 25,
  "events": [
    {
      // Base event fields
      "id": "event-id",
      "event_type": "layoff",
      "global_event_type": "Layoff",
      "company_name": "Company Name",
      "event_date": "2025-02-13 00:00:00",
      "extraction_date": "2025-02-13 19:01:18",
      "associated_article_ids": ["article-id-1", "article-id-2"],

      // Layoff-specific data
      "layoff": {
        "number_of_people_laid_off": 1000,
        "percentage_of_people_laid_off": 10,
        "min_number_of_people_laid_off": 1000,
        "max_number_of_people_laid_off": 1000,
        "summary": "Event description",
        "layoff_reason": "Stated reason",
        "is_relevant_for_real_estate": false,
        "how_much_related": "Excellent",
        "location": [
          {
            "city": "City Name",
            "county": "County Name",
            "state": "State Name",
            "country": "Country Name",
            "raw_location": "Original location text"
          }
        ]
      },

      // Article data (when requested)
      "articles": [
        // See "Working with articles" guide
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Working with articles

See [Working with articles](working-with-articles) for details about article
data structure and available fields.

## Best practices

1. Use `extraction_date` for monitoring recent layoffs and live tracking.
2. Use `event_date` for historical analysis and reporting.
3. Combine multiple filters to narrow results more precisely.
4. Consider both exact numbers and ranges when searching by employee count.
