construct search requests, and understand the returned data.

  USD, EUR, etc.

## Searching for events

Use the search endpoint to find fundraising events:

```bash
POST /api/events_search
```

### Basic request structure

```json
{
  "event_type": "fundraising",
  "attach_articles_data": true,
  "additional_filters": {
    // search criteria using available fields
  }
}
```

### Using search fields

Search by dates (absolute or relative):

```json
{
  "event_type": "fundraising",
  "additional_filters": {
    "event_date": {
      "gte": "2024-01-01",
      "lte": "2024-02-01"
    }
  }
}
```

Search by amount and funding type:

```json
{
  "event_type": "fundraising",
  "additional_filters": {
    "fundraising.amount": {
      "gte": 1000000
    },
    "fundraising.funding_type": "Series A",
    "fundraising.currency": "USD"
  }
}
```

Search by industry and investors:

```json
{
  "event_type": "fundraising",
  "additional_filters": {
    "fundraising.industry": "AI",
    "fundraising.investors": "Specific Investor Name"
  }
}
```

## Understanding the response

The API returns matched events in this structure:

```json
{
  "message": "Success",
  "count": 97,
  "events": [
    {
      "id": "event-id",
      "event_type": "fundraising",
      "global_event_type": "Finance",
      "associated_article_ids": ["article-id-1", "article-id-2"],
      "extraction_date": "2025-02-13 16:00:43",
      "event_date": "2025-02-13 00:00:00",
      "company_name": "Company Name",
      "fundraising": {
        "amount": 1000000,
        "currency": "USD",
        "funding_type": "Series A",
        "company_description": "Description of the company and its activities",
        "company_legal_name": "Company Legal Name Inc",
        "industry": "Technology",
        "founders": ["Founder Name 1", "Founder Name 2"],
        "investors": ["Investor Name 1", "Investor Name 2"],
        "valuation": "10000000",
        "summary": "Brief description of the funding round",
        "title": "Title of the funding announcement"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Best practices

1. Use date filtering to track funding trends in specific time periods.
2. Combine amount and funding type filters to find specific investment stages.
3. Search by industry and funding type to monitor sector-specific investment
   patterns.
4. Use investor names to track specific investment firms' activities.
