description: Rate limits and quota management for News API v3 usage
---

News API v3 implements rate limits and quotas to ensure fair usage and maintain
service quality for all users. This guide explains how these limits work and how
to monitor your usage.

## Understanding your limits

Your subscription plan defines the following usage limits:

- Concurrent calls: The number of simultaneous API requests you can make.
- Plan calls: The total number of API calls allowed per month.
- Historical days: The number of days in the past you can retrieve articles.

## Checking your subscription

You can view your current subscription details and remaining quota by making a
request to the `/subscription` endpoint.

### Example request

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -X GET "https://v3-api.newscatcherapi.com/api/subscription" \
 -H "x-api-token: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```

```python Python
import requests
import json

API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
URL = "https://v3-api.newscatcherapi.com/api/subscription"
HEADERS = {"x-api-token": API_KEY}

try:
    response = requests.get(URL, headers=HEADERS)
    response.raise_for_status()
    print(json.dumps(response.json(), indent=2))
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    print(f"Failed to fetch subscription details: {e}")
```

</CodeGroup>

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual API key. Use cURL, Postman, or any
other tool to make HTTP requests.

### Example response

The response will look similar to this:

```json
{
  "active": true,
  "concurrent_calls": 10,
  "plan": "v3_nlp_iptc_tags",
  "plan_calls": 250000,
  "remaining_calls": 99986,
  "historical_days": 400
}
```

### Response format

<ResponseField name="active" type="boolean">
  Indicates if your subscription is currently active.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="concurrent_calls" type="integer">
  The maximum number of simultaneous API requests you can make.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="plan" type="string">
  Your subscription plan name.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="plan_calls" type="integer">
  The total number of API calls allowed in your subscription period.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="remaining_calls" type="integer">
  The number of API calls you have left in your current period.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="historical_days" type="integer">
  The number of days in the past you can retrieve articles for.
</ResponseField>

## Rate limit behavior

If you exceed your rate limit for concurrent calls, you receive a `429` (Too
many requests) error. When this happens, wait a short time before retrying your
request. In production, consider implementing robust error handling and retry
mechanisms, such as exponential backoff or adaptive throttling, to dynamically
adjust the frequency of requests based on the server response. This approach
helps prevent hitting rate limits repeatedly and ensures smoother interactions
with the API, improving both reliability and user experience.

## Quota reset

Your quota of total calls (`plan_calls`) typically resets monthly at the
beginning of each billing cycle. The exact reset time depends on your specific
subscription terms. Any remaining calls from the previous month do not carry
over to the next month.

## Best practices

To make the most of your subscription and avoid hitting limits:

1. Monitor your usage regularly using the `/subscription` endpoint.
2. Implement efficient error handling in your code, especially for `429` errors.
3. Optimize your queries to retrieve only the data you need. Use filters and
   parameters effectively to reduce unnecessary API calls.
4. For time-sensitive applications, consider implementing a polling strategy
   with appropriate intervals rather than constant real-time requests.
5. If you're building a user-facing application, consider implementing
   pagination or "load more" functionality to fetch additional results only when
   needed.
6. If you consistently reach your limits, consider upgrading your plan to better
   suit your needs.

<Note>
  Remember, news data is highly dynamic, with millions of new articles added
  daily. Avoid caching article data for extended periods, as this could lead to
  outdated information. Instead, focus on efficient real-time data retrieval
  strategies.
