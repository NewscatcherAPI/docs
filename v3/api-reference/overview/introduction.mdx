```curl cURL
curl -X GET "https://v3-api.newscatcherapi.com/api/search?q=artificial%20intelligence" \
  -H "x-api-token: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```

```python Python
import requests
import json

API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
URL = "https://v3-api.newscatcherapi.com/api/search"
HEADERS = {"x-api-token": API_KEY}

PAYLOAD = {
    "q": "artificial intelligence"
}

try:
    response = requests.get(URL, headers=HEADERS, params=PAYLOAD)
    response.raise_for_status()
    print(json.dumps(response.json(), indent=2))
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    print(f"Failed to fetch articles: {e}")
```

</CodeGroup>

## Response format

All API responses are in JSON format and typically include the following fields:

- `status`: The status of the request.
- `total_hits`: The total number of articles matching the query.
- `page`: The current page number.
- `total_pages`: The total number of available pages.
- `page_size`: The number of articles per page.
- `articles`: An array of article objects (when applicable), each with article
  content, title, links, and other metadata. Depending on the subscription plan,
  it can include an NLP layer with sentiments, topics, tags, named entities, and
  more.
- `user_input`: An object reflecting the parameters and filters you used in your
  request, which helps confirm how the API processed your input and debug any
  issues if the results are not as expected.
