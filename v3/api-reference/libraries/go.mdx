Go SDK provides access to the News API v3 from Go applications.

## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/Newscatcher/newscatcher-go
```

## Basic usage

```go
import (
    "context"
    newscatcher "github.com/Newscatcher/newscatcher-go"
    newscatcherclient "github.com/Newscatcher/newscatcher-go/client"
    "github.com/Newscatcher/newscatcher-go/option"
)

client := newscatcherclient.NewClient(
    option.WithApiKey("YOUR_API_KEY"),
)

response, err := client.Search.Post(
    context.TODO(),
    &newscatcher.SearchPostRequest{
        Q: "renewable energy",
        PredefinedSources: []string{"top 50 US"},
        Lang: []string{"en"},
        From: "2024-01-01",
        To: "2024-06-30",
    },
)
```

## Error handling

```go
import (
    "github.com/Newscatcher/newscatcher-go/core"
    "fmt"
)

response, err := client.Search.Post(...)
if err != nil {
    if apiErr, ok := err.(*core.APIError); ok {
        fmt.Println(apiErr.Error())
        fmt.Println(apiErr.StatusCode)
    }
    return err
}
```

<Note>
  If you use our legacy Go SDK (Konfig-based), see our [Legacy
  SDKs](/v3/api-reference/libraries/legacy) documentation. We recommend
  migrating to this newer SDK for improved features and ongoing support.
