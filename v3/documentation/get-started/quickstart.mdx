  This guide will help you make your first API call to NewsCatcher News API v3
  and start retrieving news data in just a few minutes.
---

## Before you start

Before you begin, make sure you meet these prerequisites:

- An API key for NewsCatcher News API v3 (obtained from your account manager)
- Python 3.6+ installed on your system
- The `requests` library for Python

## Get started

### Step 1 - Set up your environment

First, make sure you have Python and the requests library installed. You can
install requests using pip:

```bash
pip install requests
```

### Step 2 - Create your first script

Create a new file named `newscatcher_quickstart.py` and add the following code:

```python
import requests
import json

# Configuration
API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"  # Replace with your actual API key
URL = "https://v3-api.newscatcherapi.com/api/search"
HEADERS = {"x-api-token": API_KEY, "Content-Type": "application/json"}
PAYLOAD = {
    "q": "renewable energy",
    "lang": "en",
    "page_size": 1
}

try:
    # Fetch articles using POST method
    response = requests.post(URL, headers=HEADERS, json=PAYLOAD)
    response.raise_for_status()  # Check if the request was successful

    # Print the raw JSON response
    print(json.dumps(response.json(), indent=2))

except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    print(f"Failed to fetch articles: {e}")
```

Remember to replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual API key.

### Step 3 - Run the script and review the results

Run the script from your terminal:

```bash
python newscatcher_quickstart.py
```

You should see a JSON response similar to this (shortened for readability):

```json

  "status": "ok",
  "total_hits": 10000,
  "page": 1,
  "total_pages": 10000,
  "page_size": 1,

    "sort_by": "relevancy",
    "page": 1,
    "page_size": 1
    // ...
  }
}
```

This response shows you the rich data available for each article, including
detailed metadata such as title, author, publication date, source information,
and content.

### Step 4 - Modify the query for more specific results

Now that you've seen the basic API response, let's modify our script to filter
the results and include some advanced features. Update your script as follows:

```python
import requests
import json

# Configuration
API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"  # Replace with your actual API key
URL = "https://v3-api.newscatcherapi.com/api/search"
HEADERS = {"x-api-token": API_KEY, "Content-Type": "application/json"}
PAYLOAD = {
    "q": "electric vehicles",
    "lang": "en",
    "countries": "US,GB",
    "from_": "7 days ago",
    "page_size": 10,
    "include_nlp_data": True
}

try:
    # Fetch articles using POST method
    response = requests.post(URL, headers=HEADERS, json=PAYLOAD)
    response.raise_for_status()  # Check if the request was successful

    # Parse and display the articles
    data = response.json()
    articles = data["articles"]

    print(f"Total hits: {data['total_hits']}")
    print(f"Page {data['page']} of {data['total_pages']}")
    print("---")

    for article in articles:
        title = article.get("title", "No Title")
        published_date = article.get("published_date", "No Date")
        sentiment = article["nlp"]["sentiment"]["content"]
        theme = article["nlp"]["theme"]

        print(f"Title: {title}")
        print(f"Published Date: {published_date}")
        print(f"Sentiment: {sentiment}")
        print(f"Theme: {theme}")
        print("---")

except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    print(f"Failed to fetch articles: {e}")
```

This modified script:

1. Searches for "electric vehicles".
2. Limits results to articles from the United States and Great Britain.
3. Retrieves articles from the last 7 days.
4. Returns ten articles per page.
5. Includes NLP data in the results.
6. Displays the title, publish date, content sentiment score, and theme for each
   article.

Run the script again to see the filtered results with NLP data.
