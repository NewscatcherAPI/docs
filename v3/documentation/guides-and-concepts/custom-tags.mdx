## Introduction

Custom Tags in News API v3 lets you filter and classify articles using your
unique taxonomy. This feature adapts to your specific terminology, enabling you
to track industry trends, monitor events, and analyze specialized topics,
ensuring you focus on what matters most.

## What is Custom Tags?

Custom Tags is an advanced classification feature that applies your
organization's unique taxonomy to news articles. It goes beyond simple keyword
matching - it understands the context and meaning of articles and automatically
categorizes them according to your specific classification system.

Here's what Custom Tags can do for you:

- Apply your organization's unique classification system to millions of news
  articles.
- Filter news content using your specific taxonomy.
- Get articles automatically tagged according to your classification needs.
- Access custom-tagged content through a simple API interface.

## How does it work?

Behind the scenes, Custom Tags uses a sophisticated machine learning pipeline to
understand and classify news articles according to your taxonomy. Let's look at
how we implement and maintain this system.

<Steps>

<Step title="Understanding taxonomy">

We start with your taxonomy and tag definitions. Our engineering team works with
you to learn about your domain specifics and collect extra context and examples.
This research phase ensures our language models have the comprehensive
understanding needed for accurate classification.

</Step>

<Step title="Initial model training">

We use a large language model (LLM) to create the initial classification system
based on your enriched taxonomy. This phase involves prompt engineering and
fine-tuning the model on a diverse dataset of news articles to ensure it
understands the nuances of your classification requirements and can accurately
apply your taxonomy.

</Step>

<Step title="Production deployment">

The solution is integrated into our NLP pipeline to classify all incoming news
articles with your custom tags automatically. Your custom-built classification
system is now ready and accessible via News API v3 by your API key. All articles
processed since implementation remain available, ensuring comprehensive
historical coverage.

</Step>

<Step title="Continuous improvement">

To maintain high accuracy, we continuously monitor the model's performance and
collect feedback. Regular fine-tuning and retraining help the system stay
current with evolving news trends and ensure consistent classification quality
over time.

</Step>

</Steps>

## API integration

Custom Tags are integrated into the News API v3 and available across the
following endpoints:

- `/search`
- `/latest_headlines`
- `/authors`
- `/search_similar`

<Note>
  Each taxonomy is organization-specific and protected by your API key, ensuring
  your custom classification system remains secure and private.
</Note>

### Request format

To filter articles by your taxonomy tags, use the `custom_tags` parameter
following this pattern:

- `"custom_tags.taxonomy": "Tag1,Tag2,Tag3"`,

where `taxonomy` is your taxonomy name and `Tag1,Tag2,Tag3` are specific tags.

To specify multiple tags:

- For `GET` requests, use a comma-separated string.
- For `POST` requests, use a comma-separated string or an array of strings.

Examples:

```python
import requests

url = "https://v3-api.newscatcherapi.com/api/search"
headers = {
    "x-api-token": "YOUR_API_KEY"
}

# Using a comma-separated string
payload_string = {
    "q": "*",
    "custom_tags.my_taxonomy": "Tag1,Tag2,Tag3"
}

# Using an array of strings
payload_array = {
    "q": "*",
    "custom_tags.my_taxonomy": ["Tag1", "Tag2", "Tag3"]
}

response = requests.post(url, json=payload_array, headers=headers)
```

### Response format

When you use Custom Tags, each article in the response includes a `custom_tags`
field with your taxonomy's classifications:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "total_hits": 1500,
  "articles": [
    {
      "title": "Example Article Title",
      "custom_tags": {
        "my_taxonomy": ["Tag1", "Tag2"]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

<Note>
  The custom tags in the response are always returned as an array of strings,
  regardless of the request format used.
</Note>

## Use cases

Let's look at how different organizations might use Custom Tags:

### Content classification

```json
{
  "custom_tags.content_type": ["Analysis", "Research", "Interview"]
}
```

This helps content teams organize articles by their format and depth.

### Industry monitoring

```json
{
  "custom_tags.industry": ["Manufacturing", "Supply Chain", "Logistics"]
}
```

Perfect for tracking industry-specific news and developments.

## Best practices

1. **Taxonomy design**

   - Keep tags clear and unambiguous.
   - Use consistent naming conventions.
   - Consider hierarchical relationships.

2. **Query optimization**

   - Combine custom tags with other search parameters.
   - Use date ranges for temporal analysis.
   - Consider using multiple tags for comprehensive coverage.

3. **Integration tips**

   - Start with broader queries.
   - Use exact tag names (they're case-sensitive).
   - Test different tag combinations.
