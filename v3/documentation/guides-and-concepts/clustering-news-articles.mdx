description: Group similar articles together to reduce noise and gain insights

## Introduction

Imagine walking into a massive library where all the books are scattered
randomly across the floor. Finding related information would be a nightmare,
right? That's often what it's like when dealing with large volumes of news data.
Enter clustering - a powerful feature in News API v3 that acts like a team of
lightning-fast librarians, instantly organizing articles into meaningful groups.

<Note>
  Clustering is available for all languages supported by News API v3. This
  allows you to group similar articles across the entire multilingual database.

## What is clustering?

Clustering is an advanced process that goes beyond simple keyword matching. It
uses sophisticated language processing to understand the content and context of
each article, grouping related pieces together even if they use different words
to describe the same concepts.

Here's what clustering does for you:

- Reveals connections between articles, helping you spot trends and patterns in
  large volumes of news data.
- Simplifies analysis of how different sources cover the same story.
- Saves time by automatically organizing information into coherent groups.
- Provides a clearer picture of the news landscape, making it easier to track
  evolving stories and identify emerging topics.

By leveraging clustering in News API v3, you transform a chaotic flood of
information into a structured, insightful resource, enabling more efficient and
effective news analysis.

## How does it work?

Our clustering system uses a streamlined process to group similar articles based
on their semantic similarity. The clustering process occurs dynamically at the
API level, taking into account the search filters you apply. This means you get
clusters that are tailored to your specific query, not just generic groupings.

### Embeddings generation

The foundation of our clustering process is the creation of article embeddings.
These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the content - not just the
words but the ideas behind them.

Think of these embeddings as creating a unique fingerprint for each article
based on its content.

### Similarity calculation

When you make a request that includes clustering, we use these pre-generated
embeddings to group similar articles:

1. We compare the embeddings of different articles using cosine similarity.
2. This gives us a score that tells us how similar articles are in terms of
   their content and meaning.

### Cluster formation

Based on the similarity scores, we form clusters:

1. Articles with a similarity score above our clustering threshold get grouped
   into clusters.
2. Each cluster gets a unique identifier, so you can easily refer to it later.

## How to use clustering

Clustering is only available for the
[Search](/v3/api-reference/endpoints/search/search-articles-get) and
[Latest Headlines](/v3/api-reference/endpoints/latestheadlines/retrieve-latest-headlines-get)
endpoints.

### Enable clustering

To activate clustering and fine-tune its behavior, use the following parameters
in your API request:

- `clustering_enabled` (boolean): Set to `true` to enable clustering.
- `clustering_threshold` (float): Determines how similar articles need to be to
  end up in the same cluster. Values range from 0 to 1, with higher values
  resulting in clusters with more similar articles. The default value is 0.6.
- `clustering_variable` (string): Chooses which part of the article to use for
  clustering. Options are `content` (default), `title`, or `summary`.

### Optimize clustering with page size

An important consideration when using clustering is the `page_size` parameter.
Clustering operates on one page of results at a time, affecting how articles are
grouped. To ensure the most effective clustering:

- Set `page_size` to a value greater than your expected `total_hits`.
- This allows all relevant articles to be considered for clustering together.

For example, if your query is likely to return 150 articles, set `page_size` to
at least 150. This prevents related articles from being split across different
pages and, thus, different clusters.

### Understand API response

When you enable clustering, your API response will include some new elements:

- `clusters_count`: The total number of clusters found
- `clusters`: An array of cluster objects, each containing:
  - `cluster_id`: A unique identifier for the cluster
  - `cluster_size`: The number of articles in the cluster
  - `articles`: An array of the articles in the cluster

### Code example

Here's how you might use clustering in a Python script:

```python clustering.py
import requests
import os
import json

# Configuration
API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"  # Replace with your actual API key
URL = "https://v3-api.newscatcherapi.com/api/search"
HEADERS = {"x-api-token": API_KEY, "Content-Type": "application/json"}
PAYLOAD = {
    "q": "renewable energy",
    "lang": "en",
    "clustering_enabled": True,
    "clustering_variable": "content",
    "clustering_threshold": 0.9,
}

try:
    # Fetch articles using POST method
    response = requests.post(URL, headers=HEADERS, json=PAYLOAD)
    response.raise_for_status()  # Check if the request was successful

    # Print the raw JSON response
    print(json.dumps(response.json(), indent=2))

except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    print(f"Failed to fetch articles: {e}")
```

In the response, you'll see how articles are grouped into clusters. Here's a
snippet of what you might get back:

```json response.json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "total_hits": 10000,
  "page": 1,
  "total_pages": 100,
  "page_size": 100,
  "clusters_count": 65,
  "clusters": [
    {
      "cluster_id": "7222464423361803386",
      "cluster_size": 11,
      "articles": [
        {
          "title": "Why Is NextEra Energy (NEE) The Best Alternative Fuel Stock To Buy Right Now?",
          "author": "Mashaid Ahmed",
          "published_date": "2024-08-25 17:36:01"
          // ... other article details ...
        }
        // ... other articles in the cluster ...
      ]
    }
    // ... other clusters ...
  ]
}
```

This shows that the API found 65 clusters, with one cluster containing 11
articles about NextEra Energy and alternative fuel stocks.

## Use cases

Clustering can be a game-changer in various scenarios. Here are some common use
cases:

- **Trend identification**: Quickly spot emerging trends by analyzing large
  clusters of articles on similar topics, giving you a bird's-eye view of the
  news landscape.
- **Diverse perspectives analysis**: Examine how different sources cover the
  same story within a cluster, providing a comprehensive view of news events
  from various angles.
- **Content organization**: Efficiently organize large volumes of news content
  into meaningful groups, as if you had a personal librarian instantly
  categorizing your articles.
- **Story evolution tracking**: Follow how news stories develop over time by
  analyzing changes in cluster composition and size, watching stories grow,
  merge, or fade away in real-time.
- **Enhanced search capabilities**: Improve search results by grouping related
  articles together, allowing users to quickly find relevant information with
  context-aware precision.

## Clustering vs deduplication

While both clustering and deduplication help organize large sets of articles,
they serve different purposes:

| Feature              | Clustering                                 | Deduplication                               |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| Purpose              | Groups similar articles                    | Removes nearly identical articles           |
| Content              | Retains all articles                       | Removes duplicates                          |
| Similarity Threshold | Generally lower, allowing broader groups   | Higher, identifying near-exact matches      |
| Output               | Groups of related articles                 | Set of unique articles                      |
| Use Case             | Analyzing related content, tracking trends | Eliminating redundancy, ensuring uniqueness |

Choose clustering when you want to analyze related content and track trends. Go
for deduplication to eliminate redundancy and ensure uniqueness in your article
set.
