This guide explains the Natural Language Processing (NLP) features available in
News API v3, how to use them, and their practical applications. By leveraging
these NLP capabilities, you can extract meaningful insights from news data,
enhancing your analysis, research, and application development.

## Understanding NLP layer

When processing news, we summarize the article content, categorize articles by
theme, estimate the overall tone of the writing, and identify important names
and places mentioned in the text. As a result, we supply each processed article
with additional NLP information that you can use when making requests via News
API v3.

The NLP layer in News API v3 consists of the following components:

| Component      | Description                                                              | Plan Requirement  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------- |
| Theme          | General topic or category of the article                                 | v3_nlp            |
| Summary        | Concise overview of the article's content                                | v3_nlp            |
| Sentiment      | Separate scores for title and content sentiment                          | v3_nlp            |
| Named Entities | Identified persons, organizations, locations, and miscellaneous entities | v3_nlp            |
| IPTC Tags      | Standardized news category tags                                          | v3_nlp_iptc_tags  |
| IAB Tags       | Content categories for digital advertising                               | v3_nlp_iptc_tags  |
| Custom Tags    | Organization-specific classification system                              | All v3 NLP plans  |
| Embeddings     | 1024-dimensional vector representation for semantic similarity           | v3_nlp_embeddings |

### Including NLP data in API responses

To control NLP data in your API responses, use the following parameters:

- `include_nlp_data` (boolean): Set to `true` to include the NLP object for each
  article in response.
- `has_nlp` (boolean): Set to `true` to filter the results to only articles with
  available NLP data.

<Note>
  Some fields within the NLP object may be empty or `null` if specific analyses
  were not performed on the article. The full data is available for articles in
  English and Arabic only.
</Note>

#### How these parameters work together

These parameters control both the article filtering and the inclusion of NLP
data:

- `include_nlp_data=true, has_nlp=false`: Returns all matching articles with the
  NLP object included in each. The completeness of NLP data varies by language.
- `include_nlp_data=true, has_nlp=true`: Returns only articles processed with
  NLP. This combination filters out many articles in languages other than
  English and Arabic.
- `include_nlp_data=false`: The NLP object is not included in the response,
  regardless of the `has_nlp` value.

#### NLP coverage by language

The NLP coverage and available features varies by language:

- **English and Arabic**: All the articles in these languages undergo
  comprehensive NLP processing with all features: theme, summary, sentiment
  analysis, named entities, and content tags.
- **Other languages**: Only 10% of non-English/Arabic articles undergo NLP
  processing. In addition, they have limited NLP features (theme, summary, and
  tags).
- **All languages**: Unlike other NLP features, we produce vector embeddings for
  nearly 100% of articles across all languages, making this the most universal
  NLP feature. For more information, see the
  [Embeddings](/v3/documentation/guides-and-concepts/nlp-features#embeddings)
  section.

<Warning>
  When working with non-English/Arabic content, using `has_nlp=true`
  substantially reduces the result set.
</Warning>

### Code example

Here's how you can make a request to include NLP data in your search results
using Python:

```python nlp_request.py
import requests
import json
import os

# Configuration
API_KEY = os.getenv("NEWSCATCHER_API_KEY")  # Set your API key as an environment variable
if not API_KEY:
    raise ValueError("API key not found. Please set the NEWSCATCHER_API_KEY environment variable.")

URL = "https://v3-api.newscatcherapi.com/api/search"
HEADERS = {"x-api-token": API_KEY, "Content-Type": "application/json"}
PAYLOAD = {
    "q": "artificial intelligence",
    "lang": "en",
    "include_nlp_data": True,
    "has_nlp": True
}

try:
    # Fetch articles using POST method
    response = requests.post(URL, headers=HEADERS, json=PAYLOAD)
    response.raise_for_status()  # Check if the request was successful

    # Print the raw JSON response
    print(json.dumps(response.json(), indent=2))

except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    print(f"Failed to fetch articles: {e}")
```

Here's a snippet of what you might see in the response, focusing on the NLP data

  ]
}
```

This response shows the rich NLP data available for each article, including
theme classification, summary, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and
content tagging. Let's examine each of these components.

## Theme classification

Theme classification categorizes articles into predefined topics, allowing for
efficient filtering and organization of news content.

### Available themes

News API v3 supports the following themes:

- `Business`
- `Economics`
- `Entertainment`
- `Finance`
- `Health`
- `Politics`
- `Science`
- `Sports`
- `Tech`
- `Crime`
- `Financial Crime`
- `Lifestyle`
- `Automotive`
- `Travel`
- `Weather`
- `General`

### Filtering by theme

Use the `theme` and `not_theme` parameters to filter articles based on their
classified themes:

- `theme` (string): Includes articles matching the specified theme(s).
- `not_theme` (string): Excludes articles matching the specified theme(s).

Example:

```json
{
  "q": "electric vehicles",
  "theme": "Automotive,Tech",
  "not_theme": "Entertainment"
}
```

This query returns articles about electric vehicles categorized under Automotive
or Tech themes, excluding Entertainment.

## Article summarization

Article summarization provides concise overviews of article content, allowing
for quick understanding without reading the full text.

### Using summaries in searches and clustering

You can use summaries in your searches and clustering:

- In searches, use the `search_in` parameter:

  ```json
  {
    "q": "climate change",
    "search_in": "summary",
    "lang": "en"
  }
  ```

  This query searches for `climate change` within article summaries, potentially
  yielding more relevant results than searching the full content.

- For clustering, use summaries as the clustering variable:

  ```json
  {
    "q": "renewable energy",
    "clustering_enabled": true,
    "clustering_variable": "summary"
  }
  ```

  This approach can lead to more concise and focused clusters. For more
  information on clustering, see
  [Clustering news articles](/v3/documentation/guides-and-concepts/clustering-news-articles).

## Sentiment analysis

Sentiment analysis determines the emotional tone of an article. News API v3
provides sentiment scores for both the title and content, ranging from -1
(negative) to 1 (positive).

### Filtering by sentiment

Filter articles based on sentiment scores using these parameters:

- `title_sentiment_min` and `title_sentiment_max` (float): Filter by title
  sentiment
- `content_sentiment_min` and `content_sentiment_max` (float): Filter by content
  sentiment

Example:

```json
{
  "q": "climate change",
  "content_sentiment_min": 0.2,
  "content_sentiment_max": 1.0,
  "lang": "en"
}
```

This query returns articles about climate change with a positive content
sentiment (scores between 0.2 and 1.0).

## Named Entity Recognition (NER)

NER identifies and categorizes named entities within the text. News API v3
recognizes four types of entities:

- `PER_entity_name` (string): Person names.
- `ORG_entity_name` (string): Organization names.
- `LOC_entity_name` (string): Location names.
- `MISC_entity_name` (string): Miscellaneous entities cover named entities
  outside of the person, organization, or location categories, such as events,
  nationalities, products, and works of art.

These parameters support boolean operators (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`), proximity
search with `NEAR`, and count-based filtering.

Example of a NER query:

```json
{
  "q": "tech industry",
  "ORG_entity_name": "Apple OR Microsoft",
  "PER_entity_name": "\"Tim Cook\" OR \"Satya Nadella\"",
  "include_nlp_data": true
}
```

This query searches for articles about the tech industry that mention Apple or
Microsoft as organizations and Tim Cook or Satya Nadella as persons.

To learn more about NER, see
[How to search by entity](/v3/documentation/how-to/search-by-entity).

## Tagging

Content tagging provides a standardized categorization of news articles,
enhancing searchability and enabling more precise content filtering. IPTC and
IAB tags are available in the `v3_nlp_iptc_tags` plan. Custom tags are developed
upon request and are available in all NLP plans.

### IPTC tags

IPTC (International Press Telecommunications Council) tags are a standardized
set of news categories. They offer a hierarchical classification system for news
content.

To filter articles by IPTC tags use the following parameters:

- `iptc_tags` (string): Includes articles with specified IPTC tags.
- `not_iptc_tags` (string): Excludes articles with specified IPTC tags.

Example:

```json
{
  "q": "artificial intelligence",
  "iptc_tags": "20000002",
  "lang": "en"
}
```

This query searches for AI-related articles tagged with specific IPTC category,
`20000002` encodes arts and entertainment.

For a complete IPTC Media Topic NewsCodes list, visit the
[IPTC website](https://www.iptc.org/std/NewsCodes/treeview/mediatopic/mediatopic-en-GB.html).

### IAB tags

IAB (Interactive Advertising Bureau) tags provide a standardized taxonomy for
digital advertising content.

To filter articles by IAB tags use the following parameters:

- `iab_tags` (string): Includes articles with specified IAB tags.
- `not_iab_tags` (string): Excludes articles with specified IAB tags.

Example:

```json
{
  "q": "finance",
  "iab_tags": "Business,Investing",
  "not_iab_tags": "Personal Finance",
  "lang": "en"
}
```

This query returns finance-related articles categorized under `Business` or
`Investing` but not `Personal Finance`.

For more information on IAB Content Taxonomy, visit the
[IAB Tech Lab website](https://iabtechlab.com/standards/content-taxonomy/).

### Custom tags

Custom tags help you classify and filter articles based on your organization's
taxonomy. Each taxonomy is organization-specific and protected by your API key,
ensuring your custom classification system remains secure and private. We
develop and integrate this solution upon your request. Simply provide us with
your tags and their descriptions.

To filter articles by your taxonomy tags, use the `custom_tags` parameter
following this pattern:

- `"custom_tags.taxonomy": "Tag1,Tag2,Tag3"`,

where `taxonomy` is your taxonomy name and `Tag1,Tag2,Tag3` are specific tags.

To specify multiple tags:

- For `GET` requests, use a comma-separated string.
- For `POST` requests, use a comma-separated string or an array of strings.

Example:

```json
{
  "q": "market trends",
  "custom_tags.my_taxonomy": ["Tag1", "Tag2", "Tag3"],
  "lang": "en"
}
```

For implementation details and examples, see
[Custom tags](/v3/documentation/guides-and-concepts/custom-tags).

## Embeddings

Vector embeddings provide a powerful way to represent article content as
numerical vectors, enabling advanced semantic analysis and similarity
comparisons. Available exclusively with the `v3_nlp_embeddings` plan, each
article is processed through the
[multilingual-e5-large model](https://huggingface.co/intfloat/multilingual-e5-large)
to generate its vector representation.

The embedding is available in the `new_embedding` field as an array of 1024
numbers. Here's an example of how it appears in the API response:

```json
{
  "articles": [
    {
      "title": "AI Breakthrough in Healthcare",
      "nlp": {
        "new_embedding": [0.023, -0.156, 0.789, ...], // 1024-dimensional vector
        // ... other NLP fields
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

These high-dimensional vectors capture the semantic meaning of articles,
enabling various advanced applications:

- Semantic search: Find articles with similar meanings, not just matching
  keywords.
- Content recommendation: Suggest related articles based on semantic similarity.
- Topic clustering: Group articles by meaning using vector similarity.
- Machine learning: Train models using these dense numerical representations.
