This guide explains the Natural Language Processing (NLP) features available in
News API, how to use them, and their practical applications. By leveraging
these NLP capabilities, you can extract meaningful insights from news data,
enhancing your analysis, research, and application development.

## Understanding NLP layer

When processing news, we summarize the article content, categorize articles by
theme, estimate the overall tone of the writing, and identify important names
and places mentioned in the text. As a result, we supply each processed article
with additional NLP information that you can use when making requests via News
API v3.

The NLP layer in News API consists of the following components:

| Component      | Description                                                                                         | Plan Requirement  |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Theme          | General topic or category of the article                                                            | v3_nlp            |
| Summary        | Concise overview of the article's content                                                           | v3_nlp            |
| Sentiment      | Separate scores for title and content sentiment                                                     | v3_nlp            |
| Named Entities | Identified persons, organizations, locations, and miscellaneous entities                            | v3_nlp            |
| Translations   | English translations of non-English content (one-way only): title, content, summary, named entities | v3_nlp            |
| IPTC Tags      | Standardized news category tags                                                                     | v3_nlp_iptc_tags  |
| IAB Tags       | Content categories for digital advertising                                                          | v3_nlp_iptc_tags  |
| Custom Tags    | Organization-specific classification system                                                         | All NLP plans     |
| Embeddings     | 1024-dimensional vector representation for semantic similarity                                      | v3_nlp_embeddings |

[Subscription plans](/v3/documentation/get-started/news-api-v3-subscription-plans).

### Including NLP data in API responses

To control NLP data in your API responses, use the following parameters:

- `include_nlp_data` (boolean): Set to `true` to include the NLP object for each
  article in response.
- `has_nlp` (boolean): Set to `true` to filter the results to only articles with
  available NLP data.
- `include_translation_fields` (boolean): Set to `true` to include translation
  fields in the response.

<Note>
  Some fields within the NLP object may be empty or `null` if specific analyses
  were not performed on the article. The full data is available for articles in
  English and Arabic only. Translation features are only available with the NLP
  plan or higher.
</Note>

#### How these parameters work together

These parameters control both the article filtering and the inclusion of NLP
data:

- `include_nlp_data=true, has_nlp=false`: Returns all matching articles with the
  NLP object included in each. The completeness of NLP data varies by language.
- `include_nlp_data=true, has_nlp=true`: Returns only articles processed with
  NLP. This combination filters out many articles in languages other than
  English and Arabic.
- `include_nlp_data=false`: The NLP object is not included in the response,
  regardless of the `has_nlp` value.
- `include_translation_fields=true`: Includes translation fields
  (`title_translated_en` and `content_translated_en`) in the response.

#### NLP coverage by language

All articles receive NLP processing through one of two methods:

| Feature                          | Native (Original Content)          | Translation-Based (All Languages)     | Notes                                                |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Theme classification             | English & Arabic (100%)            | All languages via translation         | Use `nlp.theme` for both                             |
| Summary                          | English & Arabic (100%)            | All languages via translation         | Native: `nlp.summary`, Translation: `nlp.summary_translated` |
| Sentiment analysis               | English & Arabic (100%)            | All languages via translation         | Use `nlp.sentiment` for both                         |
| Named entity recognition         | English & Arabic (100%)            | All languages via translation (100%)  | Native: `nlp.ner_*`, Translation: `nlp.translation_ner_*` |
| Content tags (IPTC/IAB)          | English & Arabic (100%)            | All languages via translation         | Use `nlp.iptc_tags_*` and `nlp.iab_tags_*` for both |
| Vector embeddings                | All languages (nearly 100%)        | N/A                                   | Use `nlp.new_embeddings`                             |
| Clustering                       | All languages                      | N/A                                   | Available for all content                            |
| Deduplication                    | All languages                      | N/A                                   | Available for all content                            |

<Note>
  **How it works**: Non-English/Arabic articles are automatically translated to English, then NLP processing is performed on the translation. Results are available in `translation_*` fields (e.g., `nlp.translation_ner_PER`, `nlp.summary_translated`). To learn how to access and search translation-based NLP data, see [Search in translations](/v3/documentation/how-to/search-in-translations).
</Note>

For a complete list of supported languages, see
[language codes in News API](/v3/api-reference/overview/enumerated-parameters#language-lang-and-not-lang).

### Code example

Here's how you can make a request to include NLP data in your search results
using Python:

```python nlp_request.py
import requests
import json
import os

# Configuration
API_KEY = os.getenv("NEWSCATCHER_API_KEY")  # Set your API key as an environment variable
if not API_KEY:
    raise ValueError("API key not found. Please set the NEWSCATCHER_API_KEY environment variable.")

URL = "https://v3-api.newscatcherapi.com/api/search"
HEADERS = {"x-api-token": API_KEY, "Content-Type": "application/json"}
PAYLOAD = {
    "q": "artificial intelligence",
    "lang": "en",
    "include_nlp_data": True,
    "has_nlp": True
}

try:
    # Fetch articles using POST method
    response = requests.post(URL, headers=HEADERS, json=PAYLOAD)
    response.raise_for_status()  # Check if the request was successful

    # Print the raw JSON response
    print(json.dumps(response.json(), indent=2))

except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    print(f"Failed to fetch articles: {e}")
```

Here's a snippet of what you might see in the response, focusing on the NLP data
for a single article:

</Accordion>

This response shows the rich NLP data available for each article, including
theme classification, summary, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and
content tagging. Let's examine each of these components.

## Theme classification

Theme classification categorizes articles into predefined topics, allowing for
efficient filtering and organization of news content.

### Available themes

News API supports the following themes:

- `Business`
- `Economics`
- `Entertainment`
- `Finance`
- `Health`
- `Politics`
- `Science`
- `Sports`
- `Tech`
- `Crime`
- `Financial Crime`
- `Lifestyle`
- `Automotive`
- `Travel`
- `Weather`
- `General`

### Filtering by theme

Use the `theme` and `not_theme` parameters to filter articles based on their
classified themes:

- `theme` (string): Includes articles matching the specified theme(s).
- `not_theme` (string): Excludes articles matching the specified theme(s).

Example:

```json
{
  "q": "electric vehicles",
  "theme": "Automotive,Tech",
  "not_theme": "Entertainment"
}
```

This query returns articles about electric vehicles categorized under Automotive
or Tech themes, excluding Entertainment.

## Article summarization

Article summarization provides concise overviews of article content, allowing
for quick understanding without reading the full text.

### Using summaries in searches and clustering

You can use summaries in your searches and clustering:

- In searches, use the `search_in` parameter:

  ```json
  {
    "q": "climate change",
    "search_in": "summary",
    "lang": "en"
  }
  ```

  This query searches for `climate change` within article summaries, potentially
  yielding more relevant results than searching the full content.

- For clustering, use summaries as the clustering variable:

  ```json
  {
    "q": "renewable energy",
    "clustering_enabled": true,
    "clustering_variable": "summary"
  }
  ```

  This approach can lead to more concise and focused clusters. For more
  information on clustering, see
  [Clustering news articles](/v3/documentation/guides-and-concepts/clustering-news-articles).

## Sentiment analysis

Sentiment analysis determines the emotional tone of an article. News API
provides sentiment scores for both the title and content, ranging from -1
(negative) to 1 (positive).

### Filtering by sentiment

Filter articles based on sentiment scores using these parameters:

- `title_sentiment_min` and `title_sentiment_max` (float): Filter by title
  sentiment
- `content_sentiment_min` and `content_sentiment_max` (float): Filter by content
  sentiment

Example:

```json
{
  "q": "climate change",
  "content_sentiment_min": 0.2,
  "content_sentiment_max": 1.0,
  "lang": "en"
}
```

This query returns articles about climate change with a positive content
sentiment (scores between 0.2 and 1.0).

## Named Entity Recognition (NER)

NER identifies and categorizes named entities within text content. News API
recognizes four types of entities:

- `PER_entity_name`: Person names
- `ORG_entity_name`: Organization names
- `LOC_entity_name`: Location names
- `MISC_entity_name`: Miscellaneous entities (events, nationalities, products,
  works of art, etc.)

### NER Coverage and Language Support

| NER Type              | Language Coverage                               | Response Fields                                                                                             |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Original Content**  | 100% English, 100% Arabic, ~10% other languages | `nlp.ner_PER`, `nlp.ner_ORG`, `nlp.ner_LOC`, `nlp.ner_MISC`                                                 |
| **Translation-Based** | 100% all languages (via English translations)   | `nlp.translation_ner_PER`, `nlp.translation_ner_ORG`, `nlp.translation_ner_LOC`, `nlp.translation_ner_MISC` |

These parameters support boolean operators (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`), proximity
search with `NEAR`, and count-based filtering.

To learn more about NER, see
[How to search by entity](/v3/documentation/how-to/search-by-entity).

## Translation features

We translate and index all non-English articles to English, enabling you to
search multilingual content using English keywords and perform named entity
recognition across all languages. This feature is available in the NLP plan and
higher.

### Searching in translated content

You can use English keywords to find relevant content in non-English articles by
using the `search_in` parameter with translation options:

- `title_translated`: Search in English translations of titles
- `content_translated`: Search in English translations of content
- `summary_translated`: Search in summaries of English translations
- `title_content_translated`: Search in both English translated titles and
  content

### Available translation fields

When using translation features, the API can include these additional fields in
responses:

- `title_translated_en`: English translation of the article title
- `content_translated_en`: English translation of the article content
- `nlp.summary_translated`: Brief AI-generated summary of the English
  translation
- `nlp.translation_ner_PER`: Person entities extracted from English translations
- `nlp.translation_ner_ORG`: Organization entities extracted from English
  translations
- `nlp.translation_ner_LOC`: Location entities extracted from English
  translations
- `nlp.translation_ner_MISC`: Miscellaneous entities extracted from English
  translations

For detailed translation search capabilities, see
[Search in translations](/v3/documentation/how-to/search-in-translations).

## Tagging

Content tagging provides a standardized categorization of news articles,
enhancing searchability and enabling more precise content filtering. IPTC and
IAB tags are available in the `v3_nlp_iptc_tags` plan. Custom tags are developed
upon request and are available in all NLP plans.

### IPTC tags

IPTC (International Press Telecommunications Council) tags are a standardized
set of news categories. They offer a hierarchical classification system for news
content.

To filter articles by IPTC tags use the following parameters:

- `iptc_tags` (string): Includes articles with specified IPTC tags.
- `not_iptc_tags` (string): Excludes articles with specified IPTC tags.

Example:

```json
{
  "q": "artificial intelligence",
  "iptc_tags": "20000002",
  "lang": "en"
}
```

This query searches for AI-related articles tagged with specific IPTC category,
`20000002` encodes arts and entertainment.

For a complete IPTC Media Topic NewsCodes list, visit the
[IPTC website](https://www.iptc.org/std/NewsCodes/treeview/mediatopic/mediatopic-en-GB.html).

### IAB tags

IAB (Interactive Advertising Bureau) tags provide a standardized taxonomy for
digital advertising content.

To filter articles by IAB tags use the following parameters:

- `iab_tags` (string): Includes articles with specified IAB tags.
- `not_iab_tags` (string): Excludes articles with specified IAB tags.

Example:

```json
{
  "q": "finance",
  "iab_tags": "Business,Investing",
  "not_iab_tags": "Personal Finance",
  "lang": "en"
}
```

This query returns finance-related articles categorized under `Business` or
`Investing` but not `Personal Finance`.

For more information on IAB Content Taxonomy, visit the
[IAB Tech Lab website](https://iabtechlab.com/standards/content-taxonomy/).

### Custom tags

Custom tags help you classify and filter articles based on your organization's
taxonomy. Each taxonomy is organization-specific and protected by your API key,
ensuring your custom classification system remains secure and private. We
develop and integrate this solution upon your request. Simply provide us with
your tags and their descriptions.

To filter articles by your taxonomy tags, use the `custom_tags` parameter
following this pattern:

- `"custom_tags.taxonomy": "Tag1,Tag2,Tag3"`,

where `taxonomy` is your taxonomy name and `Tag1,Tag2,Tag3` are specific tags.

To specify multiple tags:

- For `GET` requests, use a comma-separated string.
- For `POST` requests, use a comma-separated string or an array of strings.

Example:

```json
{
  "q": "market trends",
  "custom_tags.my_taxonomy": ["Tag1", "Tag2", "Tag3"],
  "lang": "en"
}
```

For implementation details and examples, see
[Custom tags](/v3/documentation/guides-and-concepts/custom-tags).

## Embeddings

Vector embeddings provide a powerful way to represent article content as
numerical vectors, enabling advanced semantic analysis and similarity
comparisons. Available exclusively with the `v3_nlp_embeddings` plan, each
article is processed through the
[multilingual-e5-large model](https://huggingface.co/intfloat/multilingual-e5-large)
to generate its vector representation.

The embedding is available in the `new_embedding` field as an array of 1024
numbers. Here's an example of how it appears in the API response:

```json
{
  "articles": [
    {
      "title": "AI Breakthrough in Healthcare",
      "nlp": {
        "new_embedding": [0.023, -0.156, 0.789, ...], // 1024-dimensional vector
        // ... other NLP fields
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

These high-dimensional vectors capture the semantic meaning of articles,
enabling various advanced applications:

- Semantic search: Find articles with similar meanings, not just matching
  keywords.
- Content recommendation: Suggest related articles based on semantic similarity.
- Topic clustering: Group articles by meaning using vector similarity.
- Machine learning: Train models using these dense numerical representations.

## Use cases

NLP features in News API enable various applications across industries:

| Application              | Description                                                 | Example use case                                                                           |
