title: Articles Deduplication
description: Enhance search efficiency by filtering out duplicate articles.

## Introduction

In today's fast-paced news environment, significant events often receive
extensive coverage from various media outlets, resulting in numerous similar
articles published across multiple platforms. To address this effectively and
provide exclusive content, we've equipped our News API v3 with an advanced
deduplication feature. This method enhances data management and conserves time
and resources by eliminating duplicate articles.

## Deduplication Process

Our system identifies and excludes duplicate articles using semantic similarity
and character-level analysis techniques. Here's a detailed breakdown of our
process:

### Semantic Similarity Comparison

We begin with an embedding-based text comparison of the articles:

1. We convert texts into vector representations (embeddings) using our Natural
   Language Processing (NLP) pipeline.
2. These embeddings capture the meaning and relationships of the content,
   allowing us to gauge the semantic similarity of the articles.
3. As a metric, we use cosine similarity with a threshold of 0.95 to identify
   potential duplicates.

This method allows us to identify semantically similar articles, even if they
use different wording.

To learn more, see
[Vector Embeddings](https://www.elastic.co/what-is/vector-embedding) and read
about [Cosine Similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity) on
Wikipedia.

### Levenshtein Distance Analysis

After the initial screening, we refine our process using the Levenshtein
distance. This metric helps us determine the minimum number of single-character
edits required to change one text into another, ensuring that articles
discussing similar topics in different ways aren't mistakenly marked as
duplicates.

We apply specific thresholds:

- 0.97 for titles
- 0.92 for content

These thresholds help us maintain high accuracy in our deduplication process.

[Levenshtein Distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) on
Wikipedia.

### Identifying Original Article

Our system doesn't just spot duplicates - it also identifies which article is
likely the original. We use a scoring algorithm that considers factors such as:

- Domain credibility
- Author's reputation

The article with the highest score is designated as the original or "parent"
article. This status may shift if a newly found duplicate presents a higher
score, reflecting the dynamic nature of news content.

### Continuous Updates and Historical Lookup

Our deduplication system is continually updated and checks for duplications over
a rolling historical period of seven days. This means that when we encounter a
new article, we compare it with all articles from the past week to identify
potential duplicates.

## Using Deduplication Feature

The deduplication feature is available for the Search endpoint only. To exclude
duplicate articles from the search, set the `exclude_duplicates` parameter to
`true`.

Each article object in the response contains additional fields:

- `duplicate_count`: the number of duplicates associated with the article.
- `duplicate_articles_group_id`: a unique identifier for a group of duplicates
  associated with the article.

<Note>
  {" "}
  The deduplication feature supports only English-language articles. Applying the
  exclude_duplicates parameter to non-English articles triggers a validation error.{" "}

### Example Request

Here's an example of how to make a request using Python:

```python request.py
import requests
import json

url = "https://v3-api.newscatcherapi.com/api/search"
payload = json.dumps({
  "q": "market value",
  "lang": "en",
  "theme": "Tech",
  "exclude_duplicates": True
})
headers = {
  'x-api-token': 'YOUR-API-KEY',
  'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  'Accept': 'application/json'
}
response = requests.request("POST", url, headers=headers, data=payload)
print(response.text)
```

### Example Response

In the response, you'll find deduplication information for each article,
including:

```json response.json
{
  "title": "Global Financial Services Industry - Insights Around Market Size, Key Trends And Forecast, 2024: Grand View Research, Inc.",
  ...
  "duplicate_count": 5,
  "duplicate_articles_group_id": "542def7ce3844c269d5f1a929309e6da"
}
```

This indicates that the article has five duplicates, which have been excluded
from the results due to the `exclude_duplicates` parameter.

## Related Feature: Clustering

While deduplication focuses on identifying and removing nearly identical
articles, our API also offers a clustering feature for grouping similar articles
without removing any content. This can be useful for analyzing trends or
providing multiple perspectives on a topic.

## Wrapping It Up

Our deduplication process guarantees you receive only unique, high-quality,
relevant news articles. By storing both unique articles and their duplicates, we
offer you a choice between complete datasets for detailed analysis and a more
distinctive, duplicate-free set of articles. This ensures you get the most out
of the news data, whether conducting in-depth research or looking for original
content.
