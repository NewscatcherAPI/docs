## Introduction

Ever tried tracking news about a company only to get flooded with articles about
similarly named businesses? You're not alone. In today's complex media
landscape, many companies share names, making it challenging to track the
specific one you care about. That's where entity disambiguation comes in.

## What is entity disambiguation?

Entity disambiguation is an advanced process that helps you cut through the
noise and precisely identify the companies you want to track in news articles.
The challenge isn't just about finding articles that mention a company name â€”
it's about ensuring those articles are actually about your target company.

Here's the core problem entity disambiguation solves:

- Many companies share the same or similar names.
- Unique identifiers like domain URLs, social media handles, or founder names
  aren't always mentioned.
- Simple keyword searches can return a mix of relevant and irrelevant results.

Entity disambiguation addresses these challenges by:

- Using sophisticated language processing to accurately identify specific
  companies.
- Leveraging multiple identifiers to confirm article relevance.
- Providing flexible filtering options to match your precision needs.
- Ensuring you get news only about the companies you care about.

## How does it work?

Our entity disambiguation system uses a multi-step process to accurately
identify company mentions in news articles. Let's break down how it works.

### Smart article retrieval

The process begins with sophisticated article retrieval that combines:

- Company's legal name
- Website URL
- Clean name from the Clearbit API

For companies with names that might be common words, the system follows these
steps:

1. Search the full company name over a week-long period.
2. If results exceed 10,000, categorize the name as a common word.
3. Limit searches to the `ner_ORG` field for better precision.

For example, for a company named "Riot":

```json
ORG_entity_name: "\"riot\" OR \"riot.com\" OR \"Riot\""
```

### Filter flag creation

The system creates flags based on company identifiers found in articles:

- `is_domain_present`: Company's domain URL mention
- `is_company_name_present_in_title`: Company name in the article title
- `is_company_name_present_in_ai_generated_summary`: Company name in AI summary
- `is_alias_present_in_content`: Company aliases in content
- `is_alias_present_in_title`: Company aliases in title
- `founder_present`: Company founder mention
- `founder_present_percent`: Percentage of founders mentioned

### Semantic similarity analysis

A crucial component is calculating the similarity between article text and
company descriptions:

1. Converts both company description and article sentences into vector
   embeddings.
2. Uses cosine similarity to measure semantic relatedness.
3. Produces similarity scores ranging from 0 (unrelated) to 1 (identical).

This analysis adds fields to the `entity_disambiguation` object:

- `average_cosine_similarity`: Mean similarity across all relevant sentences
- `highest_cosine_similarity`: Highest similarity score found
- `relevant_sentences`: Array of relevant sentences with similarity scores

<Note>
  Higher cosine similarity scores indicate stronger semantic similarity to the
  company's description, helping prioritize the most relevant articles.

## Data structure and delivery

### Response format

Each article object includes entity disambiguation data in this format:

```json
{
  "title": "Implementing Neural Networks in TensorFlow (and PyTorch)",
  // ... (other standard article fields)
  "entity_disambiguation": {
    "average_cosine_similarity": 0.3923861011862755,
    "highest_cosine_similarity": 0.4942742586135864,
    "relevant_sentences": [
      {
        "sentence": "TensorFlow is a comprehensive ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources for building and deploying machine learning applications.",
        "cosine_similarity": 0.4942742586135864
      }
      // ... (other relevant sentences)
    ],
    "founder_present": null,
    "founder_present_percent": null,
    "is_domain_present": true,
    "is_company_name_present_in_title": true,
    "is_company_name_present_in_ai_generated_summary": true,
    "is_alias_present_in_content": true,
    "is_alias_present_in_title": true
  },
  "company_name": "TensorFlow",
  "company_aliases": "TensorFlow",
  "cluster_id": "16552780591689057479"
}
```

### Delivery method

Data is delivered via AWS S3 bucket dumps. By default, new "folders" (S3 key
prefixes) are created daily, containing the latest data for all monitored
companies. Customized delivery frequencies can be arranged to meet client needs.

## Use cases

Entity disambiguation is particularly valuable for:

- **Financial Services**: Get precise news about specific companies for informed
  investment decisions.
- **Public Relations**: Track accurate media mentions of client companies.
- **Legal and Compliance**: Monitor relevant news about specific client
  companies.
- **Investment Firms**: Track news about portfolio companies without noise.
- **Corporate Communications**: Monitor accurate media coverage.
- **Regulatory Bodies**: Track specific companies under jurisdiction.
