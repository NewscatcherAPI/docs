## Overview

Advanced querying techniques allow users to construct sophisticated search
queries, enabling efficient retrieval of precise and relevant news content.
These techniques are crucial for productive information extraction from the vast
database of articles available through the API.

## Key querying techniques

In the context of the NewsCatcher News API v3, advanced querying techniques
refer to using specific syntax and operators within the `q` parameter to create
complex, highly targeted search queries. These techniques include exact
matching, boolean operators, wildcards, and proximity-based searching.

### Exact match ("double quotes")

Use double quotes to search for an exact phrase or name.

- Syntax: `"phrase or name"`
- Example: `q="Tim Cook"`
- Use case: Always use double quotes for company names, person names, and
  specific phrases.

Without quotes, the query is treated as individual terms combined with the `AND`
operator. For example, `q=Tim Cook` is equivalent to `q=Tim AND Cook`.

#### Escaping double quotes in JSON queries

To use exact match syntax in JSON queries, you must escape double quotes by
adding a backslash `\` before each double quote. This ensures the JSON is valid
and the query is interpreted correctly.

**Example:**

    ```json
    {
      "q": "presidential election",
      "PER_entity_name": "\"Kamala Harris\" AND \"Donald Trump\"",
      "include_nlp_data": true
    }
    ```

<Tip>
  Always use backslashes `\` before double quotes within query strings to
  maintain exact match syntax in JSON.

### Boolean operators

#### `AND`

- Ensures all specified terms are present in the text.
- It's the default operator when multiple words are used without quotes.
- Syntax: `term1 AND term2` or simply `term1 term2`
- Example: `q=Microsoft AND Tesla` or `q=Microsoft Tesla`

#### `OR`

- Matches articles containing either of the specified terms.
- Syntax: `term1 OR term2`
- Example: `q=(Apple AND Cook) OR (Microsoft AND Gates)`

#### `NOT`

- Excludes articles containing the specified term.
- Syntax: `term1 NOT term2`
- Example: `q=Tesla NOT "Elon Musk"`

### Wildcards (\* and ?)

- `*`: Matches any string of any length.
- `?`: Matches any single character.
- Example: `q=Microsoft AND C?O` (matches CEO, CFO, CTO, etc.)

### Proximity-based search (`NEAR`)

The `NEAR` operator finds articles where specified terms appear close to each
other.

- Syntax: `NEAR("phrase_A", "phrase_B", distance, in_order)`
- Example: `q=NEAR("browser", "Edge", 15)`
- This finds articles where "browser" and "Edge" appear within 15 words of each
  other.
- If the `in_order` parameter (default: false) can ensure phrase_B appears after
  phrase_A when set to true.

Limitations:

- Maximum 4 words per phrase
- Maximum 3 phrases per NEAR operation
- Maximum distance of 100 words

## Best practices

1. Start with broader searches and refine as needed.
2. Use double quotes for companies, person names, and specific phrases.
3. Use parentheses to group related terms in complex queries with boolean
   operators.
4. Utilize `NEAR` to find related terms within a specific context.
5. URL-encode the `q` parameter in `GET` requests to prevent issues with special
   characters.
6. Check the `user_input` field in the JSON response to confirm the correct
   interpretation of your keywords.
7. Combine multiple techniques for more precise results.

## Examples of complex queries

- Market Research:

```bash
q="artificial intelligence" AND (healthcare OR "medical research") AND NEAR("market growth", "emerging trends", 20)
```

- Competitive Analysis:

```bash
q=("Apple" OR "Google") AND "smartphone market" AND NOT ("Samsung" OR "Huawei")
```

- Event Monitoring:

```bash
q=("climate change" OR "global warming") AND (conference* OR summit) AND NEAR("Paris agreement", implementation, 15)
```

## Comparison of techniques

| Technique                     | Strengths                             | Limitations                   | Best For                  |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Exact Match                   | Precise phrase matching               | May miss relevant variations  | Specific names or phrases |
| Boolean Operators             | Versatile, combines multiple concepts | Can become complex            | Comprehensive searches    |
| Wildcards                     | Broadens search to include variations | Can return irrelevant results | Exploring related terms   |
| Proximity-Based Search (NEAR) | Finds related terms in context        | Limited to 100-word distance  | Concept relationships     |
