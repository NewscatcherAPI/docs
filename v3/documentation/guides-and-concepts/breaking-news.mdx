<Warning>
  Breaking news is currently in beta. We do not recommend using it in production
  as it may undergo changes.

## Overview

Breaking news represents important news stories rapidly gaining traction across
multiple sources. Our system identifies these stories through automated analysis
of news coverage patterns, allowing you to discover high-impact events as they
emerge.

A breaking news event is characterized by:

- Coverage from multiple different sources and authors
- Rapid publication within a short time frame
- Significant importance within a specific topic area

## How it works

Our breaking news detection works through several interconnected stages:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clustering">
    Recently published articles are automatically grouped together based on
    their content similarity.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Validation">
    Each cluster undergoes analysis for breaking news signals, including:
    - Publication frequency (sudden spikes in coverage) 
    - Source diversity (coverage across multiple publishers) 
    - Coverage quality (presence of high-ranking news sources)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deduplication">
    The system filters out duplicate content within clusters while preserving
    source diversity.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Historical Analysis">
    New candidates get compared against recent breaking news to track continuing
    stories.
  </Step>
  <Step title="AI Evaluation">
    An AI analysis step confirms whether potential breaking news clusters
    represent significant events.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Classification">
    Clusters that meet the breaking news criteria receive a special flag in the
    system.
  </Step>
</Steps>

When you query the `/breaking_news` endpoint, you receive the most
representative article from each breaking news cluster. Results are ordered by
cluster size, so the most widely covered breaking news appears first.

## Breaking news endpoint

The `/breaking_news` endpoint provides access to breaking news stories through
simple API calls.

### Base URL

```
https://v3-api.newscatcherapi.com/api/breaking_news
```

### HTTP Methods

- `GET`: Query parameters in the URL
- `POST`: Parameters in request body (JSON)

### Request examples

<CodeGroup>

```bash GET
curl -X GET "https://v3-api.newscatcherapi.com/api/breaking_news?theme=Business&page_size=100&top_n_articles=5" \
  -H "x-api-token: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

```bash POST
curl -X POST "https://v3-api.newscatcherapi.com/api/breaking_news" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-token: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "theme": "Business",
    "page_size": 100,
    "top_n_articles": 5
  }'
```

</CodeGroup>

### Response format

The API returns a JSON object with the following structure:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "total_hits": 465,
  "page": 1,
  "total_pages": 5,
  "page_size": 100,
  "breaking_news_events": [
    {
      "event_id": "15610469432059813057",
      "articles_count": 5842,
      "articles": [
        // Individual articles within this breaking news event
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

The response contains an array of breaking news events, each with its associated
articles. The structure includes:

- `breaking_news_events`: Array of breaking news events, each representing a
  significant news cluster
  - `event_id`: Unique identifier for the breaking news event/cluster
  - `articles_count`: Total number of articles in this breaking news cluster
  - `articles`: Array of articles related to this breaking news event (limited
    by the `top_n_articles` parameter)

## Use cases

The breaking news endpoint is valuable in several scenarios:

### Timely information discovery

Media monitoring teams can quickly identify emerging stories without manually
tracking multiple sources. When a significant event occurs, the breaking news
endpoint immediately highlights it based on its sudden surge in coverage.

### Content curation

Content teams can discover trending stories to feature in newsletters, websites,
or apps. Instead of manually checking multiple sources, the breaking news
endpoint automatically identifies stories gaining traction across the media
landscape.

### Market intelligence

Financial and business analysts can be alerted to significant events affecting
markets, companies, or industries. By monitoring breaking news in specific
business sectors, analysts can identify potentially market-moving information
faster.

### Crisis monitoring

Organizations can quickly identify emerging crises related to their industry,
brand, or interests. The breaking news endpoint helps detect sudden increases in
coverage about topics of concern, enabling faster response.
