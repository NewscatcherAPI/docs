## Overview

Empowered by Named Entity Recognition (NER), News API v3 lets you find articles
mentioning specific people, organizations, locations, or other named entities.
With NER, you can perform more precise and relevant searches than with simple
keyword queries.

## Before you start

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- An active API key for NewsCatcher News API v3
- NLP functionality enabled in your subscription plan
- Basic knowledge of making API requests
- Python or another tool for making HTTP requests (e.g., cURL, Postman, or a
  programming language with HTTP capabilities)

## Steps

<Steps>
    <Step title="Understand entity types and search syntax">

    News API v3 supports four main entity types that reflect the following query
    parameters:

    - `PER_entity_name`: Person names
    - `ORG_entity_name`: Organization names
    - `LOC_entity_name`: Location names
    - `MISC_entity_name`: Miscellaneous names (products, events, nationalities,
      etc.)

    </Step>

    <Step title="Construct your query using entities">
    Let's start with a simple entity search for a tech company:

    ```json
    {
      "q": "tech industry",
      "ORG_entity_name": "OpenAI"
    }
    ```

    This query searches for articles about the tech industry that mention OpenAI as
    an organization.

    You can expand your search to include multiple entities:

    ```json
    {
      "q": "tech industry",
      "ORG_entity_name": "OpenAI AND Microsoft"
    }
    ```

    </Step>

    <Step title="Include NLP data in the API response">

To include entity information in the API response, use the `include_nlp_data`
parameter:

```json
{
  "q": "tech industry",
  "ORG_entity_name": "OpenAI AND Microsoft",
  "include_nlp_data": true
}
```

To learn more about NLP capabilities in News API v3, see
[NLP features](/v3/documentation/guides-and-concepts/nlp-features).

    </Step>
    <Step title="Make an API request with your entity query">

Here's a Python example demonstrating a search request using named entities:

```python
import requests
import json

API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
URL = "https://v3-api.newscatcherapi.com/api/search"
HEADERS = {"x-api-token": API_KEY}

PAYLOAD = {
    "q": "tech industry",
    "ORG_entity_name": "OpenAI AND Microsoft",
    "include_nlp_data": True,
    "lang": "en"
}

try:
    response = requests.post(URL, headers=HEADERS, json=PAYLOAD)
    response.raise_for_status()
    print(json.dumps(response.json(), indent=2))
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    print(f"Failed to fetch articles: {e}")
```

    </Step>

    <Step title="Analyze the results">

The API returns a JSON response. Here's a simplified example focusing on
entity-related fields:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "total_hits": 325,
  "page": 1,
  "total_pages": 4,
  "page_size": 100,
  "articles": [

    "include_nlp_data": true,
    "ORG_entity_name": "OpenAI AND Microsoft"
    // ... other input parameters
  }
}
```

    </Step>
    <Step title="Refine your entity search">

Use the COUNT functionality to filter based on entity mention frequency:

```json
{
  "q": "tech industry",
  "ORG_entity_name": "COUNT(\"Apple\", 2, \"gt\") OR COUNT(\"Microsoft\", 2, \"gt\")",
  "include_nlp_data": true
}
```

Use different entity types together:

```json
{
  "q": "tech industry",
  "ORG_entity_name": "Apple OR Microsoft",
  "PER_entity_name": "\"Tim Cook\" OR \"Satya Nadella\"",
  "include_nlp_data": true
}
```

Combine entity search with boolean operators for more complex queries:

```json
{
  "q": "tech industry AND (innovation OR \"artificial intelligence\")",
  "ORG_entity_name": "(Apple OR Microsoft) AND NOT Google",
  "include_nlp_data": true
}
```

Use the NEAR operator to find articles where terms are mentioned in proximity to
each other and combine with entity search:

```json
{
  "q": "NEAR(\"tech industry\", \"innovation\", 10)",
  "ORG_entity_name": "Apple OR Microsoft",
  "include_nlp_data": true
}
```

    </Step>

</Steps>

<Tip>
  Always use backslashes `\` before double quotes within query strings to
  maintain exact match syntax in JSON.
