## Overview

Understanding the sources covered by News API v3 is crucial for ensuring the
comprehensiveness and reliability of your news data analysis. This guide will
walk you through the process of checking source coverage using the `/source`
endpoint, including how to handle large numbers of sources efficiently.

## Before you start

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- An active API key for NewsCatcher News API v3
- Basic knowledge of making API requests
- Python or another tool for making HTTP requests (e.g., cURL, Postman, or a
  programming language with HTTP capabilities)

## Steps

<Steps>
<Step title="Understand key parameters">

To make a valid request to the `/sources` endpoint, use at least one of the
following key parameters:

- `lang`: The language(s) of the sources.
- `countries`: The countries where the news publishers are located.
- `predefined_sources`: Predefined top sources per country.
- `source_name`: Text to search within source names. You can specify any word,
  term, phrase, or outlet name.
- `source_url`: The domain(s) of the news publication to search for. When
  specifying this parameter, you can only use `include_additional_info` as an
  extra parameter.

To refine your search and obtain addional source info, you can use:

- `include_additional_info`: Set to `true` to get extra details about each
  source.
- `from_rank` and `to_rank`: Filter sources by their SEO rank.

For detailed descriptions and usage of all parameters, refer to the
[Sources reference documentation](/docs/v3/api-reference/endpoints/sources/retrieve-sources-post).

</Step>
<Step title="Construct a query and make an API request">

Here's a Python example demonstrating how to check for sources containing a
specific word:

```python Python
import requests
import json

API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
URL = "https://v3-api.newscatcherapi.com/api/sources"
HEADERS = {"x-api-token": API_KEY}

PAYLOAD = {
    "source_name": "sport",
    "include_additional_info": True
}

try:
    response = requests.post(URL, headers=HEADERS, json=PAYLOAD)
    response.raise_for_status()
    data = response.json()
    print(json.dumps(data, indent=2))
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    print(f"Failed to fetch source information: {e}")
```

</Step>
<Step title="Analyze the response">

The API response will include information about the requested source(s). Here's
an example response:

```json JSON
{
  "message": "Maximum sources displayed according to your plan is set to 1000",
  "sources": [
    {
      "name_source": "Sports Illustrated",
      "domain_url": "si.com",
      "logo": null,
      "additional_info": null
    },
    {
      "name_source": "Sportskeeda",
      "domain_url": "sportskeeda.com",
      "logo": null,
      "additional_info": null
    }
    // ... other sources
  ],
  "user_input": {
    "lang": null,
    "countries": null,
    "predefined_sources": null,
    "include_additional_info": true,
    "from_rank": null,
    "to_rank": null,
    "source_name": ["sport"],
    "source_url": null
  }
}
```

This response shows a list of sources that include "sport" in their names.

<Note>
  Search by `source_name` does not perform an exact match and returns all
  sources that contain the specified term anywhere in their names.
</Note>

</Step>
<Step title="Check coverage for specific sources">

To check coverage for specific sources, you can use the `source_url` parameter
for precise filtering:

```python Python
PAYLOAD = {
    "source_url": ["si.com", "sportskeeda.com"],
    "include_additional_info": True
}
```

You can also combine multiple parameters to narrow down your search. For
example, to find sports-related sources in English-speaking countries:

```python Python
PAYLOAD = {
    "source_name": "sport",
    "lang": "en",
    "countries": ["US", "GB", "AU"],
    "include_additional_info": True
}
```

The response will include information for each covered source that matches your
criteria.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Handling large numbers of sources

When dealing with a large number of sources, you may have them stored in a file
(e.g., CSV or JSON). Here's an approach using asynchronous requests to check
which sources are covered by News API v3 and identify those that are not. This
implementation uses `aiohttp` and `asyncio` libraries for concurrent requests,
providing better performance and scalability.

<Note>
  The API key is stored in an environment variable for security purposes. Set
  your `NEWSCATCHER_API_KEY` in your environment before running the script.
</Note>

For example, in a Unix-like terminal (Linux or macOS), you can set it like this:

```bash
export NEWSCATCHER_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```

On Windows Command Prompt, you can use:

```cmd
set NEWSCATCHER_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```

```python
import aiohttp
import asyncio
import csv
import logging
from typing import List, Dict, Optional

This script does the following:

1. Reads source URLs from a CSV file.
2. Asynchronously checks the sources against the API in batches of 1000.
3. Identifies which sources are not covered by the API.
4. Writes the uncovered sources to a new CSV file.

To use this script:

1. Save your list of source URLs in a CSV file named `source_urls.csv`.
2. Run the script. It will create a file named `uncovered_sources.csv`
   containing the URLs not covered by News API v3.

You can then send the `uncovered_sources.csv` file to our support team. As News
API v3 is a flexible, corporate-level solution, we can manually add the sources
you need for your application.

<Note>
  This script assumes that your source URLs are in the first column of the input
  CSV. Adjust the `read_sources_from_csv` function if your file has a different
  structure.
</Note>

## Best practices

<Tip>
  Use the `include_additional_info` parameter to get insights into source
  reliability and output volume.
</Tip>
<Tip>
  Use `source_name` for a broader search and the `source_url` for more precise
  results.
</Tip>
<Tip>
  For large numbers of sources, use the batching method described above to stay
  within API limits.
</Tip>
<Note>
  Remember that the API may limit the number of sources returned based on your
  subscription plan.
