  Find articles that mention specific URLs or domains using News API
---

## Overview

News API offers powerful URL-based search capabilities, allowing you to find
articles that mention specific URLs or domains. This feature is handy for
tracking website mentions, monitoring competitors, or analyzing link patterns in
news articles.

The API provides two main parameters for URL-based searches:

- `all_links`: Searches for articles mentioning specific complete URLs.
- `all_domain_links`: Searches for articles mentioning specific domain URLs.

Using these parameters, you can refine your searches and gain valuable insights
from news articles on the web.

## Before you start

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- An active API key for NewsCatcher News API
- Basic knowledge of making API requests
- Python or another tool for making HTTP requests (cURL, Postman, or a
  programming language with HTTP capabilities)

URL-based search is available on the following endpoints:

- `/search`
- `/latest_headlines`
- `/authors`
- `/search_similar`
- `/aggregation_count`

<Note>
  In `GET` requests, you can specify multiple URLs/domains as comma-separated
  strings. `POST` requests support both comma-separated strings and arrays of
  strings.
</Note>

## Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Understand URL search parameters">

    - `all_links`: Use this parameter to search for articles that mention specific
    complete URLs. This is useful when you want to find articles linking to exact
    pages.
    - `all_domain_links`: Use this parameter to search for articles that mention
    specific domain URLs. This is helpful when you want to find articles linking
    to any page within a domain.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Construct your query">

    Here's an example of a basic query using the `all_domain_links` parameter:

    ```json
    {
      "q": "AI",
      "all_domain_links": "nvidia.com",
      "lang": "en"
    }
    ```

    This query:

    - Searches for articles about AI.
    - Looks for mentions of the NVIDIA website.
    - Limits results to English language articles.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Make an API request">

    Here's a Python example demonstrating how to make a POST request with the above
    query:

    ```python
    import requests
    import json

    API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
    URL = "https://v3-api.newscatcherapi.com/api/search"
    HEADERS = {"x-api-token": API_KEY}

    PAYLOAD = {
        "q": "AI",
        "all_domain_links": "nvidia.com",
        "lang": "en"
    }

    try:
        response = requests.post(URL, headers=HEADERS, json=PAYLOAD)
        response.raise_for_status()
        print(json.dumps(response.json(), indent=2))
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"Failed to fetch articles: {e}")
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Analyze the results">

    The API returns a JSON response. Here's a simplified example focusing on
    URL-related fields:

    ```json
    {
    "status": "ok",
    "total_hits": 264,
    "page": 1,
    "total_pages": 3,
    "page_size": 100,
    "articles": [
        {
        "title": "NVIDIA 'Powering Advanced AI' Is The New Tagline For GeForce RTX GPUs & AI PC Platforms",
        "author": "Hassan Mujtaba",
        "published_date": "2024-09-02",
        "link": "https://wccftech.com/nvidia-powering-advanced-ai-new-tagline-geforce-rtx-gpus-ai-pc-platforms",
        "domain_url": "wccftech.com",

        "word_count": 341,
        "all_links": [
            "https://www.nvidia.com",
            "https://www.amazon.com/dp/B082L36ZRY?tag=twea-20",
            "https://www.facebook.com/TweakTown",
            "https://www.threads.net/@tweaktown"
            // ... other links
        ],
        "all_domain_links": [
            "techpowerup.com",
            "threads.net",
            "youtube.com",
            "linksynergy.com",
            "nvidia.com"
            // ... other domain links
        ]
        // ... other fields
        }
        // ... other articles
    ],
    "user_input": {
        "q": "AI",
        "lang": ["en"],
        "all_domain_links": ["nvidia.com"]
        // ... other fields
    }
    }
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Refine your URL search">

    To improve your search results and gain more specific insights, consider these
    practical examples:

    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="Tracking AI reports and their impact">

    ```json
    {
    "q": "AI report",
    "all_links": [
        "https://aiindex.stanford.edu/report/",
        "https://www.stateof.ai/",
        "https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/consulting/articles/state-of-generative-ai-in-enterprise.html"
    ],
    "from_": "2024-01-01",
    "lang": "en"
    }
    ```

    This query tracks mentions of specific AI reports, helping you understand their
    impact and how they're being discussed in the media.

      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Analyzing AI in specific industries">

    ```json
    {
    "q": "AI AND (healthcare OR medicine)",
    "all_domain_links": ["who.int", "nih.gov"],
    "all_links": ["https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02448-8"],
    "lang": "en",
    "from_": "2024-01-01"
    }
    ```

    This query combines industry-specific keywords with relevant domain links and a
    specific research article (Large language models in medicine) to track AI's
    impact in healthcare.

      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Tracking AI policy and regulation">

    ```json
    {
    "q": "AI regulation",
    "all_domain_links": ["europa.eu", "whitehouse.gov", "gov.uk"],
    "lang": "en",
    "from_": "2024-01-01"
    }
    ```

    This query helps monitor AI-related policy discussions and announcements from
    major government entities.

## Best practices

- Use `all_links` to find mentions of specific pages or articles.
- Use `all_domain_links` to track mentions of a website in general, regardless
  of the specific page.
- Combine URL search with other parameters to create more targeted queries.
- Use date ranges to focus on recent developments or track changes over time.
- Be aware that very broad domain searches might return a large number of
  results. Use additional filters to narrow down your search.
- Regularly update your queries to track evolving topics and include new
  relevant URLs or domains.
