  Learn how to use correlation IDs to debug and troubleshoot API requests
---

In a distributed system like NewsCatcher, tracing requests across multiple
services is essential for effective troubleshooting. This guide explains how
correlation IDs work and how to use them to resolve issues quickly.

## What is a correlation ID?

A correlation ID is a unique identifier assigned to every request that enters
our system. This ID follows the request through all microservices and appears in
logs across our infrastructure, enabling end-to-end request tracing.

<Tip>
  Think of a correlation ID as a tracking number for your API request - it lets
  you and our support team follow the request's journey through our entire
  system.
</Tip>

In the NewsCatcher APIs, correlation IDs appear in:

- HTTP response headers as `correlation-id`
- Internal logs across our Kubernetes infrastructure
- Error tracking systems

## Why correlation IDs matter

<Info>
### Faster support resolution

When reporting issues to our support team, including the correlation ID allows
us to immediately locate all relevant logs and trace the exact path your request
took through our systems. This dramatically speeds up troubleshooting and
resolution times.

<Info>
### End-to-end request visibility

In complex operations that touch multiple services (search, filtering,
aggregation, etc.), correlation IDs let us reconstruct the complete journey of
your request and identify exactly where problems occurred.

</Info>
<Info>
### Performance analysis

For requests with unexpected latency, correlation IDs help us analyze and
optimize performance by measuring exactly how long each step in processing took.

## How to use correlation IDs

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find your correlation ID in response headers">
    Every response from the NewsCatcher API includes a `correlation-id` in the HTTP headers. You can view this:

    - In your HTTP client's response headers
    - In programming language responses by accessing the headers collection
    - In Postman under the **Headers** tab of the response

    Example correlation ID: `a702576c-2007-4b23-9ba4-cad305c84275`

</Step>
  <Step title="Include your correlation IDs in support requests">
    When contacting our support team about an API issue, always include:

    - The complete correlation ID from the response headers
    - The approximate time the request was made
    - A brief description of the expected vs. actual behavior

    This information lets us immediately locate the exact request in our logs and
    provide faster assistance.

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Without the correlation ID, debugging process would require much more
  back-and-forth and manual searching through logs.
